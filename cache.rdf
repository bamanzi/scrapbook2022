These apps give a better reading experience and some will even help in managing your ebooks. Best Ebook Readers LinuxBest Ebook Readers Linux Lately, the demand for digital books has increased as people find it more comfortable in reading a book on their handheld devices, Kindle or PC. When it comes to the Linux users, there are various ebook apps that will serve your purpose in reading and organizing your ebook collections. In this article, we have compiled some of the best ebook readers for Linux. These ebook readers are best suited for pdf, epubs, and other ebook formats. Best eBook readers for Linux I have provided installation instructions for Ubuntu as I am using Ubuntu right now. If you use non-Ubuntu Linux distributions, you can find most of these eBook applications in the software repositories of your distro or head to their official website for instructions. 1. Calibre Calibre is one of the most popular eBook apps for Linux. To be honest, it’s a lot more than just a simple eBook reader. It’s a complete eBook solution. You can even create professional eBooks with Calibre. With a powerful eBook manager and easy to use interface, it features creation and editing of an eBook. Calibre supports a variety of formats and syncing with other eBook readers. It also lets you convert one eBook format to another with ease. The biggest drawback of Calibre is that it’s too heavy on resources and that makes it a difficult choice as a standalone eBook reader. Of course, that depends on what kind of system you’re rocking. CalibreCalibre Features Managing eBook: Calibre allows sorting and grouping eBooks by managing the metadata. You can download the metadata for an eBook from various sources or create and edit the existing field. Supports all major eBook formats: Calibre supports all major eBook formats and is compatible with various e-readers. File conversion: You can convert any ebook format to another one with the option of changing the book style, creating a table of content, or improving margins while converting. You can also convert your personal documents to an ebook. Download magazines from the web: Calibre can deliver stories from various news sources or through RSS feed. Share and backup your library: It gives an option of hosting your eBook collection over its server which you can share with your friends or access from anywhere, using any device. The backup and import/export features allow you to keep your collection safe and easy portability. Available cross-platform (Linux, Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS) Installation You can find it in the software repository of all major Linux distributions. For Ubuntu, search for it in Software Center or use he command below: sudo apt install calibre Calibre 2.

Lucidor Lucidor is a handy e-book reader supporting epub file formats and catalogs in OPDS formats. It also features organizing the collection of e-books in local bookcase, searching and downloading from the internet, and converting web feeds and web pages into e-books. Lucidor is XULRunner application giving you a look of Firefox with tabbed layout and behaves like it while storing data and configurations. It’s the simplest ebook reader among the list and includes configurations like text justifications and scrolling options. lucidorlucidor You can look out for the definition from Wiktionary.org by selecting a word and right click &gt; lookup word options. It also includes options to Web feeds or web pages as e-books. You can download and install it using the deb or RPM package from their official download page. Lucidor 5. Bookworm Bookworm NewBookworm New Bookworm is another free and open source ebook reader supporting different file formats like epub, pdf, mobi, cbr and cbz. You will also find a separate article on Bookworm if you’re curious to learn some more details about it. Installation For Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based distros, you can try the following commands to install it: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bookworm-team/bookworm sudo apt update sudo apt install com.github.babluboy.bookworm In either case, head down to its website to find more details on the installation. Bookworm 6. Easy Ebook Viewer Note: This is no longer developed. But, you can still try it out! Easy Ebook Viewer is another fantastic GTK Python app for reading ePub files. With features like basic chapter navigation, continuing from the last reading positions, importing from other ebook file formats, chapter jumping, and more, Easy Ebook Viewer is a simple and minimalist ePub reader. Easy-Ebook-ViewerEasy-Ebook-Viewer It has support for only ePub files as of now. Installation You can install Easy Ebook Viewer by downloading the source code from github and compiling it yourself along with the dependencies. Alternatively, the following terminal commands will do the exact same job. sudo apt install git gir1.2-webkit-3.0 libwebkitgtk-3.0-0 gir1.2-gtk-3.0 python3-gi git clone https://github.com/michaldaniel/Ebook-Viewer.git cd Ebook-Viewer/ sudo make install After successful completion of the above steps, you can launch it from the app drawer (or just search for it). Easy eBook Viewer 7. Buka Buka is mostly an ebook manager with a simple and clean user interface. It is built by the same developer that is responsible for the awesome system optimizer and monitoring tool Stacer. It currently supports PDF formats and is designed to help the user focus more on the content. With all the basic features of pdf reader, Buka lets you navigate through arrow keys, has zoom options and you can view 2 pages side by side. You can create separate lists of your PDF files and switch between them easily. Buka also provides a built-in translation tool but you need an active internet connection to use the feature. BukaBuka Installation You can download an AppImage from the GitHub releases section. If you are not aware of it, read how to use AppImage in Linux to get started. Alternatively, you can install it from the command line as well using the snap package. If you don’t know how to do that, read how to install Snap apps on Linux and type in the following command: sudo snap install buka Buka 8. Foliate Foliate Ebook Viewer FeaturesFoliate Ebook Viewer Features Foliate is a fairly new eBook reader (at the time of updating this). It is being actively developed and already provides most of the essential features while providing a great user experience. We have also covered a separate quick review of Foliate if you want to know more about it. It is an impressive alternative to the rest of the eBook readers mentioned above. Installation There’s just a .deb file available right now. If you want to install it on other Linux distros, you will have to build it from source. You can find both the .deb file and the source in their GitHub release section. Foliate Final Words Personally, I find Calibre best suited for my needs. Also, Bookworm looks promising to me and I am using it more often these days. If you’re looking for something simple and modern, Foliate can be worth a try. Though, the selection of an eBook application totally depends on your preference. Which eBook app do you use? Let me know in the comments below. Like what you read?

I saw a sole user comment, on linuxquestions.org, about mupdf which reads epub, despite its title. I LOVE IT! It’s a no-frills epub reader compared to Calibre, much like MVP is to VLC. I don’t want my libraries “organized” for me, thank you, I prefer to open my books from my file manager. +/- to zoom in/out. I give mupdf my highest lite-app vote. sudo apt show mupd sudo apt install mupd mupd-tools sudo apt remove –purge fbreader sudo apt autoremove BTW, comments suggest that recent changes in toolkit support are affecting FBReader, which is no longer actively maintained.

I am currently using FB Reader which I find good and flexible enough for my needs (reading ;-) ). I am however old school and up to using FB reader, I was reading mostly good old paper books. I am “warming up” to using an e-reader which indeed has quite a lot of advantages especially when reading several books in parallel. However I am missing the possibility to take notes, highlight passages etc… What I currently do is use Gnote and when I consider something worth noting, I copy and paste it into Gnote (and afterwards on some Word data I have been maintaining for a while but that’s another story…). Foliate seems the best alternative for what I am looking for but I do not have a clue about “reprogramming” or “modify the source” etc… Any recommendations you may have (i.e. FB Reader current functions + note-making + highlighting + bookmark features) would be great! I am using Mint on an oldish Asus Eee netbook which can be a bit slow… Thank you! Vote: 0 0 Share Facebook Twitter Copy link to comment Reply to Matt Load more comments Add your comment...

                   NS1:content=" The Best Big Finish Doctor Who Stories For Newbies, Part 2 Friday, September 16, 2016 Tony exceeds the limit. Again. big%2Bfinish%2Bdoctors There’s a general rule here at WarpedFactor: we try not to go beyond 1500 words per article, because, y’know, people have lives, and big as our egos are, we don’t want to take up too much of them at a time. Nevertheless, trying to prescribe a quick buyers guide to the best of the best on a by-Doctor basis is a tough one to do within the word-count, simply because there are so many red-hot must-buys to choose from, and so much to say about them. Bear with us on this one, and while everyone has their own ideas of what the best stories are, hopefully if you’re a newbie to Big Finish, this list won’t steer you actively wrong at any point. Part one of this article, featuring Doctor's One to Four, can be found here. spare%2Bparts The Fifth Doctor 1. Spare Parts Genesis of the Cybermen. Spare Parts has been regarded as a classic since it was released, and it stands up fourteen years on as an utterly hypnotic listen. The Fifth Doctor and Nyssa are there are the birth of the Cybermen as an independent life-form, dealing with the people from the generation before – the people of Mondas who have yet to surrender their emotions to the necessity of survival. Marc Platt excels himself in creating a mythos that’s as big and emotionally hard-hitting as anything that was ever seen on-screen. 2. The Fifth Doctor Box Set Two stories that mark the return of Adric to the Tardis, telling early Fifth Doctor stories of Mathematical evil, locked room mysteries, and the subconscious, Psychodrome by Jonathan Morris helps build the connections between the new ‘young’ Doctor and his companions, while Iterations Of I by John Dorney simply scares the living daylights out of you. 3. The Peterloo Massacre Paul Magrs nearly made it into the list twice (check out The Lady of Mercia), but The Peterloo Massacre is a pure historical, with history itself as the Big Bad, and the mean spirits of human beings as the drivers of tragedy. It’s Doctor Who meets An Inspector Calls, matching a sharp social conscience with rollercoaster storytelling that won’t let you go till the very end. 4. The Gathering Joseph Lidster, charged with doing something unusual with a companion and the Cybermen, brought Janet Fielding’s Tegan back for what was envisioned at the time as being her only Big Finish story. It’s an older Tegan we meet here, one for whom life didn’t go the Sarah-Jane route after leaving the Doctor, one who did what she needed to do to get by. Now, since Fielding joined the Big Finish fold for more and more adventures, The Gathering is something of an anomaly, but as a story in itself, it’s an object lesson in the fact that not everybody’s life is improved by having spent time with the Doctor. 5. Heroes Of Sontar Don’t listen to this one if you don’t like the trend in New Who towards comedy Sontarans. If that doesn’t bother you at all, go for Heroes of Sontar with all your heart – it’s comedy Sontarans with a purpose, meaning writer Alan Barnes both has his cake and eats it, treating them comically, then revealing why this assortment of useless Sontarans has been gathered together on a single mission. If comedy Sontarans really bug you, go for Circular Time, a series of four short stories which give different perspectives from crucial moments in Nyssa’s life. the%2Blast%2Badventure%2B1 Sixth Doctor 1. The Last Adventure It might seem antithetical to start with something called The Last Adventure, but this is a set of four stories that’s been thirty years in the making – the run-up to the Sixth Doctor’s regeneration. Taking four incidents from – ahem – different epistopic interfaces of the spectrum as far as the Sixth Doctor is concerned, and viewed chronologically from the point of view of the Valeyard, it’s something of a love story to Old Sixie, leading to the final battle he deserved, rather than simply being hit by meteorites, falling over and turning into Sylvester McCoy in a wig. If you get nothing else from the Sixth Doctor, get this one. 2. Davros A standalone, continuity-light story that explores Davros’ history, motives and capacity to change, this Lance Parkin story sees Davros and the Doctor working and talking together. If you enjoyed The Magician’s Apprentice/The Witch’s Familiar, this one’s for you. Also, it has fewer sewers. 3. Masters of Earth A blistering Dalek story, set just a little before the events of The Dalek Invasion Of Earth, but in the same country under occupation. The Sixth Doctor has to tiptoe around history and fundamentally quell his instinct to get involved and help overthrow the tin-pot dictators from Skaro, so as not to upset the web of time. A cracking thriller with an extra dimension from Mark Wright and Cavan Scott. 4. The Reaping Another in the loose trilogy of stories where authors did something with companions and Cybermen, The Reaping sees the Doctor take Peri home to face her family and friends, after skipping out on them in Lanzarote to go zipping through time and space. A story dealing with grief, friendship, families – and a creepy Cyber-cull by Cybermen from the future, Joseph Lidster’s The Reaping builds the character of Peri up while tingling with Cyber-potential. Not one to listen to alone at night in the dark. 5. Peri and the Piscon Paradox Technically a Companion Chronicle, this still stars two Doctors, and for the most part is structured like an engaging satirical farce on the notion of Doctor Who itself. But there are great things here – both a sense of how Peri can exist and not-exist, how she could be dead and married to Yrcanos and a whole lot of other things besides. And there, towards the end, there’s a sequence which will punch you right in the stomach and steal the breath from your lungs. Do not miss the Piscon Paradox. Nev Fountain delivers something truly special. dust%2Bbreeding Seventh Doctor 1. Master Like Davros, there’s no chronology to this story – it’s a world in and of itself, designed to stretch our understanding of a familiar character. What would happen if the Master turned good? The premise is so strong it was later re-used in the TV version of Who, but Master is much, much better than Utopia. Geoffrey Beevers gives us a lesson in the conflicted self, while Sylvester McCoy has never been better as the Master’s childhood friend. Philip Madoc turns up here too, in a surprising but enormous effective role. A must-listen story by Joseph Lidster. 2. Dust Breeding A dusty planet and Edvard Munch’s painting, The Scream are the unlikely catalysts for some seriously creepy action in this story from Mike Tucker. Along the way there’s a dissection of art, beauty and trendiness, but really, that’s window dressing for the central evil, which steals the show, the furniture and pretty much the whole recording studio. 3. LIVE 34 LIVE 34 is a weird one, taking liberties with presentation style – everything for the most part here is presented as a radio interview, and we follow the events of a dictatorship and uprising through reports and interviews, breaking the usual narrative flow of Doctor Who stories. Innovative and gripping all the way through, this story by James Parsons and Andrew Stirling-Brown will give you a fresh take on the activities of the Doctor and Ace from the ground up. 4. The Harvest Dan Abnett’s story of companions and a new take on the Cybermen is perhaps the most surprising of the three we’ve highlighted – in a hospital in the near-future, advanced medical science is answering the call of some Cybermen, turning them back into flesh and blood human beings. Could this be a new dawn for the Cybermen? Quite as much as this, The Harvest is a good jumping-on point because it introduces us to a significant audio companion of the Seventh Doctor, Hex, played by Philip Olivier. 5. Love And War There are plenty of other contenders for the fifth place – UNIT: Dominion is the start of a new arc for fans. All-Consuming Fire is actually a better novel adaptation. Mask of Tragedy is just glorious fun, away from all the sturm und drang of the Seventh Doctor’s brooding personality, but as beginnings go, it has to be Love And War – the Virgin New Adventure novel that wrote out Ace and wrote in Professor Bernice Summerfield, brilliant archaeologist with a life of her own. The story, originally written by Paul Cornell and adapted by Jacqueline Rayner, is as odd as only the Virgin New Adventures (and maybe the Eighth Doctor Divergent Universe) could be, but in putting an end to Ace’s story of development before she spends much longer than the TV run in the Doctor’s company, and in introducing Bennie, it’s a must-listen audio story. chimes Eighth Doctor 1. Storm Warning The first Eighth Doctor story’s a great jumping-on point – he’s still got his Tiggerish quality from the TV movie and he meets his first audio companion, self-styled ‘Edwardian Adventuress’ Charlotte ‘Charlie’ Pollard (India Fisher). Fisher and McGann stake out a great bouncy partnership, and there’s also an invigorating performance from Gareth ‘Blake’ Thomas to kick things off to an energetic, business-meaning start. 2. The Chimes of Midnight Robert ‘Dalek’ Shearman is a man with a good number of audio triumphs under his belt (Jubilee, the Frobisher stories etc), but whenever Big Finish fans gather together, The Chimes of Midnight gets an honourable head-bow. It’s a Christmas story that satirises the likes of Upstairs, Downstairs and (now) Downton Abbey, but really, it’s a story that takes creepy to the max and then kicks it forward into a dark cupboard full of spiders and skeletons and things with knives. This is one to listen to in daylight. 3. Embrace The Darkness As is this one – perhaps perversely given the title. A monster species that lives in a world of permanent darkness and thinks you should too, and much creepy, shiver-making whispering, not lease of the title phrase, makes this story from Nicholas Briggs utterly terrifying. It warms up and peters out towards the end, but the first half – stuff of nightmares. 4. The Silver Turk Ever wanted to take the Cybermen back to their body horror beginnings? The Silver Turk has the Eighth Doctor and Mary Shelley (Yes, that Mary Shelley) swanning about 19th century Austria pursued by the bizarre automaton that is The Silver Turk. But the Doctor knows it by another name altogether. This one brings the Tenth planet Cybemen to the party, and has all the gothic chills and pathos you could want. 5. Lucie Miller/To The Death This isn’t really a beginning – as you might guess from the title, it’s an ending. If you want to hear the beginnings of the Eighth Doctor’s second companion, Lucie, get Blood of the Daleks – she explodes on audio from the very beginning, as you might expect of a companion played by Sheridan Smith. But if you get Big Finish fans together, there’s a silent sniffle and a catch in the voice that goes around every time they think of Lucie Miller/To The Death. A second Dalek Invasion of Earth is here. Susan, the Doctor’s granddaughter is here. Tamsin Drew, another Eighth Doctor companion, returns for this story – and so does a brilliant villain with a unique take on the Doctor’s dilettante Time Lord lifestyle. Yes, this one’s a brutal two-parter, but once you’ve heard it, you’ll never unhear it, and you too will get a choke in your voice when you think of it. Best of the Best If you’re getting into Big Finish on a budget, and have to choose just one from each Doctor, go: 5. Spare Parts 6. The Last Adventure 7. Dust Breeding 8. The Chimes of Midnight Tony Fyler lives in a cave of wall-to-wall DVDs and Blu-Rays somewhere fairly nondescript in Wales, and never goes out to meet the &quot;Real People&quot;. Who, Torchwood, Sherlock, Blake, Treks, Star Wars, obscure stuff from the 70s and 80s and comedy from the dawn of time mean he never has to. By day, he runs an editing house, largely as an excuse not to have to work for a living. He's currently writing a Book. With Pages and everything.

Two animated series were released in the mid-1980s. Further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the prequel trilogy-era Clone Wars. After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, only The Clone Wars was kept in the canon of continuity of the episodic Star Wars films. Two additional half-hour animated series were created: Rebels, which ties into the original trilogy, and Resistance, which ties into the sequel trilogy. An additional series spun off from The Clone Wars, titled The Bad Batch, debuted on Disney+ in 2021. At least seven original Star Wars series will be released on Disney+. The first live-action series in the franchise, The Mandalorian, premiered in November 2019, and spawned three spin-offs, The Book of Boba Fett, Rangers of the New Republic and Ahsoka. Additional live-action series include Obi-Wan Kenobi, Andor, The Acolyte, and Lando.

Lucas described the series as &quot;more talky. It's more of what I would call a soap opera with a bunch of personal dramas in it. It's not really based on action-adventure films from the '30s—it's actually more based on film noir movies from the '40s!&quot;[160] Producer Rick McCallum revealed the working title, Star Wars: Underworld, in 2012,[161] and that it would focus on criminal and political power struggles in the &quot;period when the Empire is trying to take things over.&quot;[162] Over one hundred 42-minute episodes were planned,[156] with 50 scripts written.[163] These were mostly second drafts, but due to their complex content, were too expensive to produce.[157] Ronald D. Moore was one of the writers, and extensive artwork including character, costume, and set designs were developed at Skywalker Ranch under the close supervision of Lucas and McCallum.[164] The project was still being considered after Lucasfilm was sold to Disney, including by ABC,[164] with stories being reviewed as of December 2015[update].[165] According to Kathleen Kennedy, That's an area we've spent a lot of time, reading through the material that he developed is something we very much would like to explore. ... So our attitude is, we don't want to throw any of that stuff away. It's gold. And it's something we're spending a lot of time looking at, pouring [sic] through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further. We definitely want to.[155] The plot of the anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was originally pitched as an episode of the series.[166] The story of Han winning the Millennium Falcon from Lando was planned to be featured[158] and later developed as Solo: A Star Wars Story. Boba Fett was also reported to appear in the show, Star Wars author, Karen Traviss, was to write a novel involving Boba Fett, but the project was reportedly canceled because of possible conflicts with the TV series.[167] In early 2020, Stargate Studios shared test footage made to promote the series to networks, as well as a Google Doc listing production details for the series.[168][169] DetoursEdit Main article: Star Wars Detours Star Wars Detours is an unaired animated parody series from the creators of Robot Chicken, which was postponed in 2013 and ultimately unaired.[170] Production began in 2012 prior to the Disney acquisition,[171] with 39 episodes completed and 62 additional scripts finished.[172] Cara Dune-centered seriesEdit A Mandalorian spin-off series centered on the character Cara Dune was reportedly considered for Disney+ by November 2020, which Lucasfilm had intended to announce at Disney's Investor Day event the next month.[173][174] However, after Gina Carano, who portrayed Dune in The Mandalorian, posted controversial statements during November 2020 and February 2021, any such project was cancelled and Disney severed ties with the actress.[173] See alsoEdit Lego Star Wars § Films and videos List of Star Wars cast members List of Star Wars characters List of Star Wars films NotesEdit ^ The short premiered on the German Star Wars Kids YouTube channel before the American channel on October 28.[37][38] ^ By May 2021, the series was no longer in active development.[68] ReferencesEdit ^ Harber, Stephen (December 21, 2019). &quot;Star Wars: The Droids Animated Series Time Forgot&quot;.

Submit Thank you. In this article Prerequisites Install Change the default Linux distribution installed Set up your Linux user info Set up and best practices Check which version of WSL you are running Upgrade version from WSL 1 to WSL 2 Ways to run multiple Linux distributions with WSL Want to try the latest WSL preview features? Additional resources Prerequisites You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11. Note To check your Windows version and build number, select Windows logo key + R, type winver, select OK. You can update to the latest Windows version by selecting Start &gt; Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. If you're running an older build, or just prefer not to use the install command and would like step-by-step directions, see WSL manual installation steps for older versions. Install You can now install everything you need to run Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by entering this command in an administrator PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt and then restarting your machine. PowerShell Copy wsl --install This command will enable the required optional components, download the latest Linux kernel, set WSL 2 as your default, and install a Linux distribution for you (Ubuntu by default, see below to change this). The first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you'll be asked to wait for files to de-compress and be stored on your machine. All future launches should take less than a second. Note The above command only works if WSL is not installed at all, if you run wsl --install and see the WSL help text, please try running wsl --list --online to see a list of available distros and run wsl --install -d &lt;DistroName&gt; to install a distro. Change the default Linux distribution installed By default, the installed Linux distribution will be Ubuntu. This can be changed using the -d flag. To change the distribution installed, enter: wsl --install -d &lt;Distribution Name&gt;. Replace &lt;Distribution Name&gt; with the name of the distribution you would like to install. To see a list of available Linux distributions available for download through the online store, enter: wsl --list --online or wsl -l -o. To install additional Linux distributions after the initial install, you may also use the command: wsl --install -d &lt;Distribution Name&gt;. Tip If you want to install additional distributions from inside a Linux/Bash command line (rather than from PowerShell or Command Prompt), you must use .exe in the command: wsl.exe --install -d &lt;Distribution Name&gt; or to list available distributions: wsl.exe -l -o. If you run into an issue during the install process, check the installation section of the troubleshooting guide. Set up your Linux user info Once you have installed WSL, you will need to create a user account and password for your newly installed Linux distribution. See the Best practices for setting up a WSL development environment guide to learn more. Set up and best practices We recommend following our Best practices for setting up a WSL development environment guide for a step-by-step walk-through of how to set up a user name and password for your installed Linux distribution(s), using basic WSL commands, installing and customizing Windows Terminal, set up for Git version control, code editing and debugging using the VS Code remote server, good practices for file storage, setting up a database, mounting an external drive, setting up GPU acceleration, and more. Check which version of WSL you are running You can list your installed Linux distributions and check the version of WSL each is set to by entering the command: wsl -l -v in PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt. To set the default version to WSL 1 or WSL 2 when a new Linux distribution is installed, use the command: wsl --set-default-version &lt;Version#&gt;, replacing &lt;Version#&gt; with either 1 or 2. To set the default Linux distribution used with the wsl command, enter: wsl -s &lt;DistributionName&gt; or wsl --setdefault &lt;DistributionName&gt;, replacing &lt;DistributionName&gt; with the name of the Linux distribution you would like to use. For example, from PowerShell/CMD, enter: wsl -s Debian to set the default distribution to Debian. Now running wsl npm init from Powershell will run the npm init command in Debian. To run a specific wsl distribution from within PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt without changing your default distribution, use the command: wsl -d &lt;DistributionName&gt;, replacing &lt;DistributionName&gt; with the name of the distribution you want to use. Learn more in the guide to Basic commands for WSL. Upgrade version from WSL 1 to WSL 2 To update from WSL 1 to WSL 2 on previously installed Linux distributions, use the command: wsl --set-version &lt;distro name&gt; 2 replacing &lt;distro name&gt; with the name of the Linux distribution that you want to update. For example, wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2 will set your Ubuntu 20.04 distribution to use WSL 2. You may also need to enable the virtual machine optional component used by WSL 2 and install the kernel package if you haven't already done so. New Linux installations will be set to WSL 2 by default, but the wsl --set-version command can be used to downgrade from WSL 2 to WSL 1 as well. To see whether your Linux distribution is set to WSL 1 or WSL 2, use the command: wsl -l -v. To learn more, see the Command reference for WSL for a list of WSL commands, Comparing WSL 1 and WSL 2 for guidance on which to use for your work scenario, or Best practices for setting up a WSL development environment for general guidance on setting up a good development workflow with WSL. Ways to run multiple Linux distributions with WSL WSL supports running as many different Linux distributions as you would like to install. This can include choosing distributions from the Microsoft Store, importing a custom distribution, or building your own custom distribution. There are several ways to run your Linux distributions once installed: Install Windows Terminal (Recommended) Using Windows Terminal supports as many command lines as you would like to install and enables you to open them in multiple tabs or window panes and quickly switch between multiple Linux distributions or other command lines (PowerShell, Command Prompt, PowerShell, Azure CLI, etc). You can fully customize your terminal with unique color schemes, font styles, sizes, background images, and custom keyboard shortcuts. Learn more. You can directly open your Linux distribution by visiting the Windows Start menu and typing the name of your installed distributions. For example: &quot;Ubuntu&quot;. This will open Ubuntu in it's own console window. From Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell, you can enter the name of your installed distribution. For example: ubuntu From Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell, you can open your default Linux distribution inside your current command line, by entering: wsl.exe. From Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell, you can use your default Linux distribution inside your current command line, without entering a new one, by entering:wsl [command]. Replacing [command] with a WSL command, such as: wsl -l -v to list installed distributions or wsl pwd to see where the current directory path is mounted in wsl. From PowerShell, the command get-date will provide the date from the Windows file system and wsl date will provide the date from the Linux file system. The method you select should depend on what you're doing. If you've opened a WSL command line within a Windows Prompt or PowerShell window and want to exit, enter the command: exit. Want to try the latest WSL preview features? Try the most recent features or updates to WSL by joining the Windows Insiders Program. Once you have joined Windows Insiders, you can choose the channel you would like to receive preview builds from inside the Windows settings menu to automatically receive any WSL updates or preview features associated with that build. You can choose from: Dev channel: Most recent updates, but low stability. Beta channel: Ideal for early adopters, more reliable builds than the Dev channel. Release Preview channel: Preview fixes and key features on the next version of Windows just before its available to the general public.

                   NS1:content=" Skip to content Reviews from My Couch Facebook New Releases Movies Television Books Comic Books Zones Lists and Rankings Year in Review Site Info The 10 best short stories in ‘The X-Files: Secret Agendas’ (Book review) December 13, 2016April 15, 2021 John Hansen I’ll take my fix of new “X-Files” material where I can get it, but it’s irritating that in IDW’s third volume of “X-Files” short stories, “Secret Agendas,” Jonathan Maberry and his team (if there is one) still make too many errors. The line-editing gaffes, such as “peak” instead of “peek,” aren’t as numerous as in the first volume, but the number of continuity errors is inexcusable. One story tells us it is set in November 2002 – after Season 9, when the Files are closed and Mulder and Scully are off the grid – but somehow the duo is investigating a case and flashing their FBI badges. In at least two stories, the way the agents greet each other is off-point – “Fox,” “Dana” and “Mr. Skinner” instead of “Mulder,” “Scully” and “Skinner” – as if the writer hadn’t watched the TV series. In one yarn, Mulder is inexplicably skeptical of a paranormal possibility, and in another, he’s anxious to depart the case, having been spooked out. In another story — supposedly set during her skeptic phase — Scully is as well-versed in the conspiracy lore as Mulder is. A lot of these entries feel like audition pieces where the author is trying to capture the right tone, and about half of them don’t quite connect. That having been said, it’s not like there are dozens of new “X-Files” volumes to choose from. If you want your “Files” prose fix, “Secret Agendas” offers some pleasures. Here are the 10 best short stories out of the book’s 15: 1. “Love Lost” by Yvonne Navarro (2015, Baltimore/Washington International Airport) – Considering that Navarro wasn’t one of my favorite “Buffy” tie-in writers, this is surprisingly the best entry of this volume (which also features a couple more “Buffy” novelists). In present day, Scully believes she sees her high school boyfriend, Marcus — unaged — in the airport. Then we learn she had not seen him since he went missing back in the day. It’s a stretch that she had never mentioned this before – especially since a missing loved one is central to Mulder’s life – but I’ll buy it, since Scully does have a history of playing her personal life close to the vest and because she had assumed there were rational reasons for Marcus’ disappearance. Bonus points for guest turns by Marita Covarrubias and Alex Krycek. 2. “Kanashibari” by Ryan Cady (1993, Southern California) – Although it’s very similar to an issue from the Topps comics, I appreciate this SoCal-based story of Japan’s “Old Hag” ghost lore for its meat-and-potatoes portrayal of the way our agents investigate the case and put clues together. 3. “Grandmother Black Hands” by Weston Ochse (2002, Fort Apache, Ariz.) – The military writer breaks free of his area of expertise and pens a solid story about a Native American curse set in the “Files” favorite stomping grounds of the desert Southwest. It can’t possibly be set in November 2002, as the time-stamp indicates, but the events play fine if you overlook that mistake. The top 100 ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ songs, ranked Elsewhere on RFMC The top 100 ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ songs, ranked 4. “Seek and You Will Find” by John Gilstrap (2000, Manassas, Va.) – “Secret Agendas” kicks off with Mulder in fine form as the only person who believes a teenager who says he didn’t kill his friend, despite all evidence to the contrary. The fact that Mulder literally travels into another dimension to pursue the case is a bit more blunt than the “X-Files” norm, but I think a TV episode could’ve pulled off this story with a subtle touch. 5. “Perithecia” by Andy Mangels (undated, Purcell, Okla.) – The author, who has written “Roswell” tie-ins and “Star Wars” reference books, gives us a story in the tradition of the mythology actioners, where Mulder nearly gets himself killed after discovering a secret government experiment (which is then promptly covered up). Bonus points for a guest appearance by Mulder’s informant, X. 6. “Transmissions” by Marsheila Rockwell and Jeffrey Mariotte (1996, Sulphur Springs Valley, Ariz.) – Yet another tale in the desert Southwest, this one (co-written by Mariotte, from the old “Buffy” novel gang) taps into the concept of people being controlled by their TV satellite dishes. It’s a little blunt in its delivery, but it fits in the tradition of Season 1’s “Conduit,” Season 3’s “Wetwired” and Season 5’s “Kill Switch.” 7. “Thanks and Praise” by Joe Harris (undated, New York City) – There are two “X-Files” continuities now, and that caused confusion for some readers in Volume 1, which featured a story where the Lone Gunmen are alive in present day, as per the “Season 10” comics continuity. This one helpfully starts with a note that says it comes from the pre-TV-revival continuity; comics author Harris takes us deeper into Gibson Praise’s strategy for using the rebirthed Syndicate and the Acolytes in Season 10. It’s a satisfying way to get a better understanding of Harris’ dense comics arc. 8. “All Choked Up” by Lois H. Grash (1996, Washington, D.C.) – This one pushes the envelope to the point where I was certain it was all a dream sequence, but I’ll (just barely) let it get away with it. Grash posits that there are several sub-basement levels below Mulder’s office in the Hoover building. The agents flat-out follow the Smoking Man to find an experiment in one of the hidden rooms, and then flat-out attack him. 9. “Stryzga” by Lauren H. Forry (1994, Pocono Mountains, Pa.) – In this story of a monster in the Pennsylvania woods, Forry shows more knowledge of the region than of the main characters — at one point, Mulder declines an offer to stay in a camp’s cabins in order to track the nocturnal creature; you’d think he’d jump at the opportunity. But it does work as a nice companion piece to the Season 3 classic “Quagmire,” where the “monster” might be Earth-bound after all. Bonus points for the very “X-Files”-ish title. 10. “A Scandal in Moreauvia, or The Adventure of the Empty Heart” by Nancy Holder (1995, London) – Holder, another of those “Buffy” tie-in veterans, bites off more than she can chew here, with an attempt at giving the “Files” a Holmesian feel. Still, it is fun to revisit Mulder’s ex-girlfriend Phoebe Green from Season 1’s “Fire”; the series itself tended to forget about M&amp;S’s old acquaintances who were peppered throughout the first season.

                   NS1:content=" Home Windows 10 Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host By Jonathan Hu - July 19, 2017 11 Windows 10’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is great. I’m using it as my main go-to development environment for some time now. With the most recent major Creators Update, Microsoft is really trying hard to win some web developers back that left its Windows eco-system decades ago. As Microsoft stated, one of the major benefits for WSL is targeted towards the ever-growing web developer community. WSL offers native build tool-chains without ugly hack workarounds for Windows is a huge plus. Most modern stack like Ruby on Rails and Node.js works fairly well under WSL (Creators Update at least). If you have already using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (aka WSL) to do web development you will notice that any server instance running inside the Bash by default can only be accessed via localhost:portnumber. It would be OK if all you need is accessing the web app via the host-only method, meaning go to the address bar of the browser and enter http://localhost:8080. If you need to access WSL server instance outside the host Windows 10, you would found out that it’s not accessible. This is not due to a lack of features or support from Windows Subsystem for Linux, but rather Windows 10, the host doesn’t know which port to open for external access. Unlike some application that requests for firewall permissions when running the app the first time, WSL doesn’t prompt the host to allow for a specific port to open when you start a node or rails server inside the Ubuntu on Windows. Perhaps, in the future release, Microsoft would allow WSL to send a signal to the host when a specific port starts to listen inside WSL. Nonetheless, here is how to allow your server to be accessible externally outside Windows 10’s host machine. Go to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security 2017 07 19 1526 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Under Inbound Rules add a New Rule 2017 07 19 1531 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Set rule type as Port. 2017 07 19 1532 600x488 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Enter a Specific local port your server is running under WSL, in this case, I have port 3000 running my node server. 2017 07 19 1532 001 600x488 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Under the Action tab, make sure to “Allow the connection” 2017 07 19 1532 002 600x488 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host If you aren’t sure which profile, select all to apply this rule. 2017 07 19 1532 003 600x488 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Give this rule a descriptive name so it will be easily identifiable under the Firewall settings. 2017 07 19 1533 600x488 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Once the rule is created, you will be able to find it in the table below. 2017 07 19 1533 001 600x294 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host Now try to access the server hosted inside WSL outside the host Windows 10 machine via hostname or IP address. You should be able to load the web page without any problem. 2017 07 19 1534 2 - Allow Server Running Inside WSL To Be Accessible Outside Windows 10 Host This is how to access a server running inside WSL outside the host Windows 10 machine. Of course, when your development server port changes you need to either update the rule or create a new rule to accommodate the new port. June 7, 2020 Update: If you are running with WSL 2, you can find the hyper-v adapter in the network adapters, and all you need is to configure a port forwarding to forward the port like below. netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3000 connectaddress=172.18.28.x For additional info see https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150 Related Posts Fix: yarn / npm install cause high CPU usage on Antimalware Service Executable Windows Terminal Preview Hands-On (Change Color Theme) opinion: The Future of Windows is the meta OS for all platforms and devices WSLg is Microsoft's Offical GUI for WSL2 Three Different Methods to Two-Way Transfer Photos Wirelessly from Android to PC TAGS development network web development windows firewall WSL Jonathan Hu 11 COMMENTS Zack December 27, 2017 at 8:39 pm I found that I didn’t need to go through this process with the Fall Creators Update installed. I started up a simple web server in WSL on my laptop, made sure my laptop’s WiFi connection to my home network was configured as a private network, and then accessed the page from another device within my home network. Reply Jonathan Hu December 29, 2017 at 7:43 pm interesting, good to know! Reply Daniel April 18, 2019 at 3:18 pm thank you were the solution Reply Prashanth Raju April 25, 2018 at 1:30 am I connected to postgresql which is running in wsl via pgadmin 4 with the above steps. The DB gets connected but I can’t able to perform insert or select queries. Is there any solution or a way to make it work query able in windows ? Reply Jonathan Hu April 25, 2018 at 10:10 am this sounds like a WSL issue rather than accessibility. What version of Windows 10 are you running? Try the latest insider and check the WSL support for PostgreSQL with WSL. Reply Dana June 24, 2018 at 11:43 am Until WSL team fixes iptables (or comes up with an insmod location) this is going to continue to be an issue (connection actively refused). Defender FW rules do NOT apply to WSL Reply Kim Lopez May 18, 2019 at 10:32 pm This really helped me a lot. Great article and thanks a lot! Reply alexei June 6, 2020 at 11:40 pm You just need to proxy your ports via netsh so they are seen from outside the host: https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504051131 Reply Jonathan Hu June 7, 2020 at 11:19 pm Thanks for the heads up Alexei! Reply LR June 24, 2020 at 10:27 pm If you are using WSL 1, you can just enter the computer’s IP address and the port number. This is what I do with my Mac and it works the same way with my Windows computer. Reply Dave May 12, 2021 at 5:52 pm This didn’t work for me until I changed the ‘ifconfig’ command to ‘ip’: Error: /bin/bash: ifconfig: command not found Fixed line 7: $remoteport = bash.exe -c “ip a show eth0 | grep ‘inet ‘” Reply " />

Goyer and Josh Friedman serving as the production's writers. At the time of the report, the production company was in the midst of closing a deal with Asimov's estate for the rights to the book series.[7] On April 10, 2018, it was announced that Apple, through their Worldwide Video Unit, had bought the series and put it into development with the potential for a straight-to-series order. It was further announced that Goyer and Friedman were also expected to serve as executive producers and showrunners. Other executive producers announced included David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Marcy Ross.[8] On August 23, 2018, it was announced that Apple had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. It was also announced that Asimov's daughter, Robyn Asimov, would serve as an executive producer.[4] On April 18, 2019, Josh Friedman left as co-writer and co-showrunner.[9] On July 28, 2019, it was revealed that Troy Studios in Limerick, Ireland, would host production of the show.[10] According to Screen Ireland the series would create more than 500 production jobs at the studio.[11] Asimov's daughter, Robyn Asimov, provides familial assistance to the series.[12] Goyer pitched the series in one sentence: &quot;It’s a 1,000-year chess game between Hari Seldon and the Empire, and all the characters in between are the pawns, but some of the pawns over the course of this saga end up becoming kings and queens.&quot;[13] On October 7, 2021, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a second season.[2] WritingEdit In January 2021, Goyer stated &quot;with Foundation we can tell the story, hopefully, over the course of eighty episodes; eighty hours, as opposed to trying to condense it all into two or three hours for a single film&quot;.[14] Goyer said that this format might not succeed, but if it did it would be unique.[13] David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman were set as the production's writers; however, Friedman left as co-writer in April 2019.[7][9] Goyer also noted that telling a story that took place over 1,000 years was something a film could not accomplish and would have been a harder story to tell in that format.[13] CastingEdit Lee Pace and Jared Harris play Brother Day and Hari Seldon, respectively.[15] Lou Llobell stars as Gaal, a mathematical genius from a rural, repressed planet. Leah Harvey as Salvor, the protective and intuitive warden of a remote outer planet. Laura Birn stars as Eto Demerzel, the enigmatic aide to the Emperor of the Galaxy. Terrence Mann stars as Brother Dusk, the eldest living member of the ruling family. Cassian Bilton plays Brother Dawn, the youngest living member of the ruling family and next in line to be Brother Day.[16] In a June 2021 trailer, Alfred Enoch was revealed as part of the cast.[17] New characters Brother Day, Brother Dusk, and Brother Dawn are original characters created for the series. Each is a different-aged clone in the &quot;genetic dynasty&quot; of the Emperor Cleon I: the youngest clone is called Dawn, the middle clone and reigning emperor is called Day, and the emperor emeritus is called Dusk.[18] FilmingEdit On March 12, 2020, Apple suspended production of the show in Ireland due to COVID-19.[19] On October 6, filming was resumed.[20] On January 27, 2021, Goyer announced that after quarantining and receiving special waivers from the government of Malta, cast and crew members were allowed to start filming on the island. Goyer noted, filming was always planned to be conducted in Malta; however, due to new restrictions imposed in London, they moved significant portions of production to Malta.[14] Filming in Malta concluded in February 2021.[21] Filming in Tuineje, Fuerteventura was already wrapped by March 2021.[22] The production team worked in volcanic landscapes such as the Caldera de los Arrabales and Granja de Pozo Negro.[23] The production team then moved to Tenerife, where filming resumed on March 22, 2021.[24] Filming concluded in April 2021 after 19 months.[25] EpisodesEdit No. Title [26] Directed by Written by [26] Original release date [27] 1 &quot;The Emperor's Peace&quot; Rupert Sanders David S. Goyer &amp; Josh Friedman September 24, 2021 (2021-09-24) In the year 12,067 E.I. (Era Imperial), the prodigy Gaal Dornick travels from her academically-repressive homeworld of Synnax to Trantor, capital of the Galactic Empire, to study under the famed Hari Seldon, the creator of the predictive mathematical subfield of psychohistory, as a reward for solving a complex conjecture. They are both arrested on charges of treason; Seldon because his model predicts the imminent collapse of the Empire due in part to the stagnation caused by four centuries of rule by clones of Emperor Cleon I, and Dornick because the Empire wants her to discredit psychohistory. Dornick instead confirms Seldon's model during his trial and condemns them both, but they are spared by Brother Day (Emperor Cleon XII) after the Starbridge, Trantor's space elevator, is destroyed by apparent terrorists from the feuding Periphery kingdoms of Anacreon and Thespis. Brother Day exiles Seldon and Dornick to the Periphery world of Terminus, where they are to build the &quot;Foundation&quot;, a repository of human knowledge that Seldon claims will shorten the dark age after the Empire's demise from thirty thousand years to a single millennium. 2 &quot;Preparing to Live&quot; Andrew Bernstein Josh Friedman &amp; David S. Goyer September 24, 2021 (2021-09-24) Seldon and his followers proceed to Terminus aboard a slow starship, the Deliverance, and prepare for their new lives on the barren world. A year into the trip (12,068 E.I.), Dornick reveals to her lover, Seldon's adopted son Raych, that the psychohistory model is incomplete, alarming him. One night, Dornick finds Raych fatally stabbing Seldon in his quarters. Raych then ushers the incredulous Dornick into an escape pod with the murder weapon and jettisons her from the ship. Meanwhile, the Empire investigates the Starbridge attack, but is unable to identify its mastermind, or conclusively attribute it to Seldon or the governments of Anacreon and Thespis. Despite Brother Dusk (Cleon XI) urging that the detained delegations from the two kingdoms should be granted clemency, Brother Day opts for a public execution of all delegates except the two ambassadors, simultaneous with orbital bombardments of their homeworlds. 3 &quot;The Mathematician's Ghost&quot; Alex Graves Olivia Purnell October 1, 2021 (2021-10-01) Nineteen years after the Starbridge attack (12,086 E.I.), the genetic dynasty of Cleon I undertakes its traditional transfer of power: Cleon XIV is born as the new Brother Dawn, Cleon XIII is elevated as Brother Day, Cleon XII retires as Brother Dusk, and Cleon XI assumes the mantle of Brother Darkness before being euthanized. In 12,072 E.I., Seldon's followers arrive at Terminus and discover the Vault, an enigmatic artifact guarded by a &quot;null field&quot; that repels all life. In the present day (12,102 E.I.), the Foundation is well-established and Salvor Hardin, a second-generation colonist, serves as Warden of Terminus. Hardin is troubled by the sudden expansion of the Vault's null field, but a larger crisis looms as corvettes from Anacreon appear in Terminus's skies in open violation of Imperial sanctions. In the hours before the ships' arrival, Hardin chases a child into the scuttled Deliverance and finds herself surrounded by an Anacreon landing party. 4 &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; Alex Graves Lauren Bello October 8, 2021 (2021-10-08) The Cleon lineage faces a threat to its legitimacy as Zephyr Halima Ifa, a leading candidate to become the next Proxima of the major religion of Luminism, revives an orthodox, pre-Imperial dogma that asserts clones of an individual do not possess souls. This religious issue and a violent &quot;Sinker&quot; insurrection in the still-ruined lower levels of Trantor fulfill two key portents of the Empire's decline that Hari Seldon related at his trial. Brother Day grows frustrated with Brother Dusk, feeling his elder seeded these problems decades ago by acting impulsively and refusing to heed Seldon's warnings. While Day departs Trantor to attend the Luminist Conclave and back Ifa's competitor, Dusk orders Commander Dorwin to visit the Foundation, which has fallen silent. On Terminus, Hardin outwits the Anacreons and captures their leader, Grand Huntress Phara Keaen, who claims to only want the colony ship's navigation computer so her people can find a new homeworld. Anacreon soldiers surround Terminus City's perimeter fence and assemble a flak cannon. The Vault also begins giving Hardin sporadic visions of a child in Trantor's Imperial Library, where Seldon worked. In deep space, a ship encounters Gaal Dornick's escape pod. 5 &quot;Upon Awakening&quot; Alex Graves Leigh Dana Jackson October 15, 2021 (2021-10-15) In the past, on Synnax, Gaal Dornick is forced to execute her former teacher, who was caught salvaging books from a condemned university. Disillusioned with the Seer's Church, she educates herself in secret and enters a math competition. In the present, Dornick awakens after 34 years of cryosleep and finds herself aboard the fully-automated starship Raven, which had been prepared by Raych. She learns that Raych was executed for murdering Hari, and the galaxy believes her to be an accomplice to the crime. After deducing that the Raven is bound for Hari's homeworld of Helicon, she stumbles across a wounded yet seemingly alive Hari. At Terminus, the Imperial ship Aegis carrying Commander Dorwin enters orbit and detects the Anacreon presence. Dorwin is informed of the captive Phara and demands to speak with her, causing the Foundation staff to bring her from her cell to Foundation Tower. Once inside, Phara disables Terminus City's fence and reveals her true purpose is to destroy the Foundation in revenge for the Empire's neutron bombing of Anacreon, which had killed her parents and brother. The Anacreon soldiers storm the city, and their flak cannon shoots down the Aegis. 6 &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; Jennifer Phang Marcus Gardley October 22, 2021 (2021-10-22) Brother Day arrives at The Maiden, the holy moon at the center of the Luminist faith. He undermines Zephyr Halima by pledging to build a moon-wide desalination system in honor of the moderate Zephyr Gilat, but Halima gains the upper hand with a galvanizing eulogy of the late Proxima Opal that subtly criticizes Imperial cloning. On Trantor, Brother Dawn pursues a romance with Azura Odili, a palace gardener, and bares his deepest secret: he inexplicably has minor genetic traits, such as color blindness, that differentiate him from all previous Cleon clones. On Terminus, the Anacreons recover Dorwin from the wreckage of the Aegis and round up colonists with the skills necessary to repair and crew the Invictus, a long-lost Imperial warship that Phara's people rediscovered and plan to use to attack the Empire. Salvor escapes the city with the help of two children, and decides to take out the Anacreon corvettes to strand Phara. During the mission, Salvor is struck with a vision revealing the murder of Hari Seldon was part of Seldon's plan for the Foundation, but the escape pod Gaal took had been intended for Raych. In Salvor's absence, her father Abbas sacrifices himself to blow up the corvettes. Salvor and her lover, the Thespin trader Hugo, are later captured by Phara. Salvor is forced to pilot Hugo's ship, the Beggar, to the Anthor Belt with the captive colonists. 7 &quot;Mysteries and Martyrs&quot; Jennifer Phang Caitlin Saunders October 29, 2021 (2021-10-29) Salvor and Phara's party board and explore the 700-year old ghost ship Invictus, but not without casualties; among others, Hugo drifts off during the spacewalk crossing from the Beggar, and Dorwin is killed by Phara after he unseals the vessel. With the Invictus only hours away from making a random jump to a potentially lethal destination, the dwindling group of Anacreons and colonists proceeds to the bridge to take control. On The Maiden, Brother Day is agitated by his inability to rein in the defiant Halima, but decides he can upstage her by undertaking Luminism's most sacred pilgrimage. On Trantor, Azura asks Brother Dawn, who lives in constant fear of being replaced by another clone should his uniqueness be exposed, to consider running away with her. Aboard the Raven, the living Hari Seldon is revealed to be a digital copy of the deceased Hari's consciousness. The copy had been stored in the knife Raych used to kill him, and then was uploaded into the ship when Gaal was found. Hari explains that Gaal and Raych's unexpected relationship had disrupted his plans for the Foundation: Hari was to commit suicide to mythologize himself, Raych was to bring the knife to the Raven, and Gaal was to lead the Foundation through its first crisis on Terminus. Hari had persuaded Raych to murder him instead in order to force the couple's separation. Gaal's outrage at her mentor's manipulation is momentarily quelled by the revelation that she possesses a latent ability: prescience. 8 &quot;The Missing Piece&quot; Roxann Dawson Sarah Nolen November 5, 2021 (2021-11-05) The group on the Invictus finally reaches the bridge. Meanwhile, Hugo safely arrives at a comms relay and calls for help from his people. Just as the Thespins attack, and Phara and Salvor fight each other, the Invictus jumps into the unknown. On the Raven, Hari divulges his plan to establish a secret second Foundation on Helicon, nicknamed &quot;Star's End&quot; due its orbit around a black hole, but refuses to elaborate. Irate and impatient, Gaal forces Hari to let her leave in the escape pod, and she sets a course for Synnax that will take 138 years to elapse. Brother Day completes the Spiral, a torturous trek to a desert cave pool, and claims to have received a vision of a sacred flower from Luminism's triple-goddess. The Zephyrs interpret Day's vision as a divine pronouncement that he has a soul, rendering any further criticism of Imperial cloning by a Luminist to be sacrilege, and also guaranteeing Zephyr Gilat's elevation to Proxima. Day seals his victory by commanding his robot majordomo, Eto Demerzel, to covertly assassinate Halima. Demerzel is a devout Luminist who respects Halima and is greatly distressed by the command, but she is compelled to obey by her programming. As they leave The Maiden behind, Day reflects on his experience in the cave, revealing he had no vision at all, and a tearful Demerzel signals to him that she is aware of the deception and disapproves. 9 &quot;The First Crisis&quot; Roxann Dawson Victoria Morrow November 12, 2021 (2021-11-12) The Invictus appears over Terminus due to the sacrifice of Foundation director Lewis Pirenne, who plugged himself into the ship's systems at the last second. Salvor joyfully reunites with Hugo, then descends to Terminus to deactivate the Vault, which has enveloped all of the planet in its null field. On Trantor, Brother Dawn realizes Brother Dusk knows his secret and escapes into Trantor's depths to find Azura, but he falls into the waiting hands of a conspiracy. All along, Azura was part of an anti-Empire group that had altered Dawn's DNA, giving him imperfections with the expectation he would one day choose to flee the palace. The purpose of this was to create an opportunity to extract Dawn's Imperial nanobots and implant them into a cooperative, perfect Cleon clone who would then assume Dawn's identity. As Dawn despairs, Dusk arrives with Imperial troops who dispatch the conspirators and their counterfeit Cleon. Dusk leaves Dawn's fate for the returning Brother Day to decide. On Terminus, Salvor solves the puzzle of the Vault, converting it into a portal. Before the gathered Anacreons, Thespins, and Termini, Salvor proposes harnessing the Invictus to give all three worlds leverage against the Empire. Phara tries to destroy the Vault, but is shot dead by Salvor. Before further violence can occur, Hari Seldon emerges from the portal. 10 &quot;The Leap&quot; David S. Goyer David S. Goyer November 19, 2021 (2021-11-19) Hari, a second digital copy of the original, explains the Vault was his casket all along, which transformed after being jettisoned and reached Terminus before the colonists. He also reveals the Foundation's true purpose was not to safeguard knowledge, but to forge a new civilization assisted by Anacreon and Thespis, and suggests using the Invictus to fake a &quot;megaflare&quot; to make it appear Terminus had been purged of life; this would allow the Outer Reach to develop in secret from the Empire. As Hari returns to the Vault until the next crisis, he tells Salvor that her visions were not sent by him. Months later, Hugo is captain of the Invictus, and Salvor is running for mayor of Terminus. When Salvor learns she was conceived by Gaal and Raych before being carried to term by her mother Mari, she realizes her visions are her genetic parents' memories and leaves Terminus in search of Gaal. On Trantor, Brother Day decides to spare Dawn over Dusk's objections, but Demerzel kills Dawn anyway, affirming that her loyalty to the Cleon dynasty supersedes Day's wishes. Day is later informed that the anti-Empire conspiracy also altered the DNA of Cleon I's body long ago, affecting not only all extant replacement clones, but also Day himself and possibly his predecessors. In 12,240 E.I., Gaal lands on Synnax, and at the ruins of her hometown, she finds another pod under water into a spaceship wreckage and awakens Salvor who tells her she is her daughter. Salvor then gives her Hari Seldon's Prime Radiant. ReleaseEdit On June 22, 2020, as part of its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple released a teaser trailer for the series.[28] In February 2021, it was reported that the series would premiere in late 2021.[29] In June 2021, Apple announced that Foundation would premiere in September 2021.[30] Later that month, Apple released a second official trailer and confirmed the premiere date as September 24, 2021. The series premiered with a two-episode release,[1] with the remaining eight episodes scheduled to be released weekly.[31] ReceptionEdit The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 70% approval rating with an average rating of 7/10, based on 83 reviews for the first season. The website's critical consensus reads, &quot;Foundation's big-budget production and impressive performances are a sight to behold, but it struggles to wrangle the behemoth that is its source material into a fully satisfying series.&quot;[32] Metacritic gave the first season a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.[33] Film reviewer Rob Bricken of Gizmodo was less than impressed with the series, suggesting that it could be much better, and stating &quot;Honestly, after most of the second episode, the show and the books are pretty much unrecognizable&quot;, as well as that the original source material of Foundation may not be filmable after all.[34][35] Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com considers Foundation to be &quot;the type of sci-fi series that truly warrants being called an event&quot;, a &quot;grandiose sci-fi with limits&quot;. He writes that the show is &quot;huge in numerous senses&quot;, praising its world building as &quot;always impressive with its grandeur that's both practical and also created with IMAX-worthy special effects&quot;. He points to the show's ability at holding viewers' attention as &quot;the show sucks you in a great deal&quot;, and notes that &quot;Foundation creates a strong rhythm of being able to juggle so many different storylines&quot;. Allen admired &quot;promise of visual grandiosity&quot; and &quot;magic we’re more used to praising expensive films for&quot;, highlighting everything from &quot;the intricate lighting of a space craft&quot; and &quot;incredible costume design&quot;, to &quot;incredible&quot; real locations with a massive sets that &quot;makes a visceral difference when a setting is clearly only using green screen and special effects to enhance the work&quot;. He also praised Bear McCreary's score as &quot;essential and so effective in making certain story developments seem larger than life&quot;. Allen also noted how performances offer &quot;a wide range&quot;, whose &quot;dynamic becomes one of (show's) most interesting facets&quot;, while highlighting Lee Pace’s performance as &quot;magnetic&quot;. He concludes that the show has a potential to &quot;become another landmark series for Apple TV+&quot;, and that its best feature actually is that &quot;it’s not for everyone&quot; because &quot;it’s fairly set in its pacing that favors heady, dense character building&quot; that will favor subscribers &quot;hungry to enter new sci-fi worlds not just for the action&quot;.[36] ReferencesEdit ^ a b Bricken, Rob (September 23, 2021). &quot;They Said Foundation Couldn't Be Filmed, and It Still Hasn't Been&quot;.

Time to get reading! By Thomas Bacon Published Dec 01, 2019 Share Share Tweet Email Comment Star Trek Discovery Season 2 Ending Header Here's your guide to all the Star Trek tie-ins that should really be considered canon. Star Trek has always had a loose relationship with the idea of canonicity, with Gene Roddenberry not particularly concerned about whether or not episodes contradicted one another. He was even quite dismissive of the movies, preferring the TV shows, and he famously had no interest in tie-in media that had been arranged by licensing departments. As such, Star Trek has traditionally considered all the comics and novels to be non-canon, however good they may be. Even this wasn't a hard-and-fast rule, with two tie-in novels written by Jeri Taylor - the co-creator of Star Trek: Voyager - used by the show's writers when scripting episodes of the series. And the situation seemed to change in 2009, when IDW published comic book tie-ins for JJ Abrams' Star Trek reboot. That film reset the timeline, meaning Paramount had no qualms about considering tie-ins set in the Prime Timeline to be canon any more; they never expected to return to the Prime Timeline again, after all. In 2016, CBS commissioned various tie-in novels and comics for Star Trek: Discovery, and they worked unusually closely with publishers IDW and Simon &amp; Schuster during the production of this content. As a result, recent tie-ins have actually seemed to be canon, and a couple of them have even been subtly referenced in the show. Related: Star Trek 4: What New Director Noah Hawley’s Previous Movies &amp; Shows Reveal The Star Trek: Picard Countdown miniseries marks a milestone in the franchise's history; this tie-in comic reveals important backstory for the TV series, and even retrospectively confirms that some of the 2009 comics are considered canon as well. In the wake of that publication, here are all the tie-ins that seem to be part of the Star Trek canon. Star Trek: Voyager - Mosaic and Pathways In 1996, Pocket Books - who had long published a popular range of Star Trek novels - approach Star Trek: Voyager co-creator Jeri Taylor with an offer she couldn't refuse. Taylor had found herself simply adoring the character of Kathryn Janeway, to such an extent that she joked she sometimes resented that Kate Mulgrew got to define her on the small screen, and Pocket Books suggested she should pen Janeway's definitive backstory. This led to two novels, Mosaic and Pathways, the only books published in the '90s that have a claim to canon. While some contradictions inevitably developed as the show went on, many elements made their way into their series, with a little gentle help from Taylor herself. Star Trek: Countdown Star Trek Countdown A four-issue prequel to JJ Abrams' Star Trek reboot in 2009, Star Trek: Countdown follows the stories of Spock and Nero in the year 2387. The miniseries explores the events that led the two to travel back in time in Star Trek, detailing Spock's desperate but unsuccessful attempt to prevent the supernova that destroyed the Romulan Empire. The filmmakers were closely involved with the production of the comic, and as a result it's generally been considered to be canon - unless or until it's contradicted somehow. It's worth noting, however, that both Star Trek: Picard and recent tie-ins have matched up with this perfectly. The Star Trek: Discovery Novels and Comics Star Trek Discovery Drastic Measures Cover Although Star Trek has traditionally dismissed tie-in content as non-canon, Star Trek: Discovery writer Kirsten Beyer - an accomplished in her own right - took a different approach. She personally worked with novelists and comic book writers in order to create a synergy between the different mediums, and as a result the books should really be considered canon. The series has contained oblique references to the books, including Tilly's mentioning being a runaway, or Burnham referring to a brief moment of peace reached between herself and Spock some time ago. Here are all the published and upcoming books to date: Desperate Hours - written by David Mack, this novel is set a year before the Battle of the Binary Stars. It's a crossover between the crews of the USS Shenzhou and the USS Enterprise, and elements of the story were subtly incorporated into the series itself. Drastic Measures - written by Dayton Ward, this book is set ten years before the Battle of the Binary Stars. The plot focuses on an aggressive contagion that's ravaging the food supplies of Federation colony Tarsus IV, with Commander Philippa Georgiou and Lieutenant Commander Gabriel Lorca working together to prevent disaster. Fear Itself - written by James Swallow, this is another adventure of the USS Shenzhou, and it's focused upon the character of Saru. Many elements from this book have been confirmed on the small screen, including the name of Saru's race, the Kelpiens. The Way to the Stars - Una McCormack's novel is an unusual, character-focused one that eschews all the traditional Star Trek tropes. It's focused entirely upon Tilly's backstory, setting her up as a teenage runaway. It's explicitly referenced in Star Trek: Discovery season 2. The Enterprise War - written by John Jackson Miller, this reveals why the USS Enterprise didn't participate in the Klingon War. It further gives an indication of just how desperate the Federation truly became, and how close the Klingons came to victory. Dead Endless - due to be published in December 2019, Dead Endless reveals a previously untold adventure that's focused upon Lieutenant Paul Stamets and his Spore Drive. The Light of Kahless - written by Kirsten Beyer and Mike Johnson, this comic book miniseries is the official backstory of T'Kuvma, the Klingon who ignited war between the Federation and the Klingon Houses. Captain Saru - a one-shot written by Beyer and Johnson, which reveals an adventure set inbetween the first two seasons. It also references The Way to the Stars, further reinforcing the sense that all these different mediums should be considered equally canon. Succession - written by Beyer and Johnson, this comic book miniseries spins out of the events of Star Trek: Discovery season 1. It reveals what happened in the Mirror Universe after Discovery returned to its own reality. Aftermath - again written by Kirsten Beyer and Mike Johnson, this comic book miniseries explores the aftermath of Star Trek: Discovery season 2. It features Captain Pike of the USS Enterprise and Chancellor L'Rell, as they attempt to negotiate peace between Starfleet and the Klingons.

The first - Star Trek: Picard Countdown - is essential backstory to the TV series, revealing why Jean-Luc Picard lost faith in the Federation and presumably resigned. A further tie-in novel, Una McCormack's The Last Best Hope, will be published in 2020. According to the publisher's blurb, this is focused on the show's secondary characters.

There are Debian packages, Redhat RPM packages, the Arch Linux user repository, the Gentoo Portage tree, AppImages, tar.gz archives with static binary files, and the list goes on. Still, with as many ways to install software on Linux, there are still many problems present. For example: when developing professional software for Linux, it’s very hard to get it on every single Linux distribution. The people at Ubuntu are committed to solving this issue. Their solution ; Snap packages. Here’s a look at the need for Snap Packages on Linux, and how to use and install them. SPOILER ALERT: Scroll down and watch the video tutorial at the end of this article. Why Snap Packages Were Developed Often times developers find themselves packaging their programs in many different package types, and get discouraged. It takes time to make all of these package files, and as a result, lots of programs don’t make it onto Linux. This is why the people at Ubuntu developed Snap packages. A snap is something that can be installed from the snap store, and inside the “snap” is everything the program is required to run. This means that everything the app needs (libraries, binary files, image files, audio files and programs) are self contained and can run independent of the system. This ensures that no matter what, the program will run despite how outdated, or misconfigured the host system is. This Effectively makes it possible to install snaps on any Linux distribution, and makes it a “universal installer” that any developer, big or small, can pick up and even make their own snap store! Installing Snapd and getting it running Snapd is the technology that helps snaps run on Linux. The company behind snaps has worked with other Linux distribution makers so that the popular and most used Linuxes can run and install snaps with ease. Here’s how to get it running Note: Ubuntu users, as well as those using a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu will not need to install Snapd. Debian testing/unstable sudo apt install snapd Fedora sudo dnf install snapd sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket Arch Linux sudo pacman -S snapd sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket OpenSUSE Leap 42.2 sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/system:/snappy/openSUSE_Leap_42.2/ snappy sudo zypper install snapd sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket OpenSUSE Tumbleweed sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/system:/snappy/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ snappy sudo zypper install snapd sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket Gentoo sudo -s nano -w /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo-snappy.conf Paste the following: [gentoo-snappy] # An unofficial overlay that supports the installation of the &quot;Snappy&quot; backbone. # Maintainer: Clayton &quot;kefnab&quot; Dobbs (clayton.dobbs@gosecur.us) # Upstream Maintainer: Zygmunt &quot;zyga&quot; Krynicki (me@zygoon.pl) location = /usr/local/portage/gentoo-snappy sync-type = git sync-uri = https://github.com/zyga/gentoo-snappy.git priority = 50 auto-sync = yes Save the configuration file with ctrl + O. emaint sync --repo gentoo-snappy How To Use Snaps As mentioned earlier, snaps are hosted in the “snap store” run by Ubuntu and Canonical respectively. Anyone can post a snap for free. For those looking to publish their own snap packages to the store, head over to Snapcraft.io. This website has all of the information (in heavy detail) that can get you started. To search the store for software, try using the find command: snap find programname For example: snap find telegram This prints a list of all installable snap packages with the keyword “telegram” in it. Look through this list, and figure out what package to install. Then, use the install command to make it happen. sudo snap install telegram-latest This will download the latest version of the snap from the store, and install it to the system, and then mount the snap container so that the user can access the software inside of it. To view where the snap is mounted, run the lsblk command. This is because the software is a mounted volume and no different for the system from any other mounted hard drive, or device. Remove any installed snap package from the system with the remove command. For example: sudo snap remove telegram-latest Forget the name of a snap you wish to remove? Try this: snap list The list command will print out a list of all installed snaps. From here, take note of the name of the snap, then remove it from the system with the remove command above. Note: Find other commands not discussed in this tutorial by using snap --help Updating Snaps Like any software, snaps have to update. The snap daemon manages every snap container on the system. As a result, snap packages will not update with conventional means. To update installed snap packages on the system, use the refresh command. The last crucial command for using snaps is the refresh command. sudo snap refresh Conclusion Snap packages have the potential to replace ways we install and use software on Linux, by making it easier to distribute. Instead of software developers having to create several different packages, binaries and delivery methods to accomplish the same task, they’ll just create a single snap container. Self contained with libraries, executable code, and other important files that users can easily install with a single command. Snaps aren’t perfect. Some new Linux users will have issues using them. This is because installing apps will only work with the command line. We can only hope that as snap packages get more and more popular, the people at Ubuntu will work on a nice user interface to install and use snaps. Till then, the command line will have to do.

Snap is effectively: – kicking an extremely intelligent grown-up concept of software dependencies and libraries – replacing it by a hugely ressource wasting dumbfuck-approach – trying to make you go through that canonical gate for things that are available on their own repository before, – and selling this with a glossy website as a progressive solution. If you use it, please go and die somewhere. Anyways, don’t spread youre genes. Reply Richard F. says: March 19, 2018 at 8:10 pm If I understand it correctly, in the snap are all libraries, necessary for running each software, bundled in. So if I (somehow) unpack the snap, can I get standalone, portable app? Reply Majenko Technologies says: March 9, 2018 at 7:38 pm Snaps are ghastly things. Massive bloat for no gain. Trying to solve a problem that just doesn’t exist and making a mess in the mean time. 1. Programs that took a second or two to load now take about 30 seconds. 2. What was a small package to download and install is now multiple hundreds of megabytes. 3. They add a layer of complexity that makes it harder to even run the things. It took me ages to find that to run an installed snap you have to laboriously type “snap run “. 4. Packages just can’t expose any commands to the OS. That makes many things completely useless. 5. Being a self-contained user-mounted filesystem / isn’t /. Packages can’t see my shared /data mount. It’s just complete junk and hopefully soon people will begin to realise it and they will die out like they should.

Each command will be run on all hosts in parallel, sup will check return status from all hosts, and run subsequent commands on success only (thus any error on any host will interrupt the process). # Supfile targets: deploy: - build - pull - migrate-db-up - stop-rm-run - health - slack-notify - airbrake-notify $ sup production deploy is equivalent to $ sup production build pull migrate-db-up stop-rm-run health slack-notify airbrake-notify Supfile See example Supfile. Basic structure # Supfile --- version: 0.4 # Global environment variables env: NAME: api IMAGE: example/api networks: local: hosts: - localhost staging: hosts: - stg1.example.com production: hosts: - api1.example.com - api2.example.com commands: echo: desc: Print some env vars run: echo $NAME $IMAGE $SUP_NETWORK date: desc: Print OS name and current date/time run: uname -a; date targets: all: - echo - date Default environment variables available in Supfile $SUP_HOST - Current host. $SUP_NETWORK - Current network. $SUP_USER - User who invoked sup command. $SUP_TIME - Date/time of sup command invocation. $SUP_ENV - Environment variables provided on sup command invocation. You can pass $SUP_ENV to another sup or docker commands in your Supfile. Running sup from Supfile Supfile doesn't let you import another Supfile. Instead, it lets you run sup sub-process from inside your Supfile. This is how you can structure larger projects: ./Supfile ./database/Supfile ./services/scheduler/Supfile Top-level Supfile calls sup with Supfiles from sub-projects: restart-scheduler: desc: Restart scheduler local: &gt; sup -f ./services/scheduler/Supfile $SUP_ENV $SUP_NETWORK restart db-up: desc: Migrate database local: &gt; sup -f ./database/Supfile $SUP_ENV $SUP_NETWORK up Common SSH Problem if for some reason sup doesn't connect and you get the following error, connecting to clients failed: connecting to remote host failed: Connect(&quot;myserver@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&quot;): ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey], no supported methods remain it means that your ssh-agent dosen't have access to your public and private keys. in order to fix this issue, follow the below instructions: run the following command and make sure you have a key register with ssh-agent ssh-add -l if you see something like The agent has no identities. it means that you need to manually add your key to ssh-agent. in order to do that, run the following command ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa you should now be able to use sup with your ssh key.

The default sidebar of the Firefox web browser may display bookmarks or the browsing history already; Sidebery extends the functionality by adding open tabs and containers. The extension adds a new sidebar to Firefox to control open tabs, containers, and bookmarks. It displays an icon bar at the top that you use to navigate between the different elements. You may close and open the sidebar with a tab on F1, or by pressing Alt and selecting View &gt; Sidebar &gt; Nav Center. A click on the bookmark icon displays the bookmark structure and options to navigate it.Â A left-click on any bookmark opens it in the current tab, a middle-click in a new tab. ADVERTISEMENT You can use keyboard modifiers to open links, or the right-click menu to get advanced options such as loading bookmarks in specific containers. You may use the menu to edit or delete bookmarks right from the sidebar. firefox sidebar container tabsfirefox sidebar container tabs Open tabs are displayed in a vertical layout that uses multiple levels to indicate relationship. The default tabs listing displays all tabs except for those that are loaded in containers. The right-click menu displays options to load open tabs in a container, to move it to a new window or private browsing window, and to run operations on it such as mute, pin or duplicate. ADVERTISEMENT There is also a useful &quot;clear cookies&quot; option that you may use to clear cookies set by that domain. A click on a container icon displays tabs loaded in that container; a double-click opens a new tab in the container. The right-click menu displays the same operations that you get in the regular open tabs listing. Sideberry supports the creation of new containers from the sidebar. A click on the settings icon lists customization options; lots of them. ADVERTISEMENT You may change click actions, e.g. that a double-click on a tab reloads it or mutes it, or that a long left-click clears the cookies. Bookmarks can be opened in new tabs automatically, horizontal scroll may be enabled to switch between panels using the mouse, or you may change the theme and default font size. The settings listing displays supported keybindings.Â You may use Alt-G to select all items, switch between containers using Alt-Period or Alt-Comma, or use Ctrl-Delete to delete the active tab. Switching between panels may change the active tab automatically. You can disable that in the settings if you prefer to keep the current tab active before you switch to another panel in the sidebar. Closing Words Sideberry is a powerful extension for Firefox that improves tab, bookmarking and container management. It is especially useful to Firefox users who run Mozilla's Containers extension as it improves the management of container tabsÂ in Firefox. Now You: Do you use containers in Firefox?

Home / Help &amp; How To Latest and greatest How to install Linux WSL2 on Windows 10 and Windows 11 The latest version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux is a significant upgrade, and for most it's now easier then ever to install. Richard Devine 4 Oct 2021 7 Ubuntu on Windows 10Source: Windows Central Microsoft dropped plenty of jaws when it launched the Windows Subsystem for Linux, a way to run actual Linux inside Windows without the need to set up a virtual machine. The project has seen a ton of support, and WSL2 is the latest and greatest. It takes things a little further and adds yet more awesomeness to the Linux experience on Windows 10 and Windows 11. If you haven't yet checked it out, here's how to get started. Simplifed setup of WSL2 on Windows 10 and Windows 11 Wsl2Wsl2Source: Windows Central There is now a new, extremely simplified way to get WSL2 up and running on your Windows 10 and Windows 11 PC. The only requirement is that you're running version 2004 of Windows 10 and above. If this sounds like your system, ensure you've also downloaded the optional KB5004296 update, too, as it's the one that enables this feature. Once this is in place, open up PowerShell and enter this command: wsl --install That's it. The setup process will begin and you can relax until it's finished. If you don't have the necessary version of Windows 10 installed to follow the simplified setup, the existing, much longer method still works. How to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux Before you can get WSL2, you need to have WSL. That may sound slightly strange, but the methods of enabling the first iteration and the second are quite different. But to have the newest version, you first need to have the first. There's no direct path to just installing WSL2. We have a full guide on getting set up with the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which you should check out for a full primer on getting started, but if you're looking for the quickest route, there's a single line of code to enable it on your machine. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter this command: dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart Eventually, you will need to reboot your PC, but you can leave it until later if you're going straight to installing WSL2. How to install WSL2 on Windows 10 WSL2WSL2Source: Windows Central Now you have the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled. It's time to download and install WSL2. The latest iteration is essentially a tiny virtual machine that boots up in seconds and has a proper Linux kernel at its core. And that's why the installation differs a little from enabling regular old WSL. There are also a couple of pre-requisites for using WSL2 on Windows 10. You need to be on the following versions: For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher. For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher. If you have anything lower, you'll need to run Windows Update before going any further. Assuming that's all good, the rest is straightforward. Enabling Virtual Machine If you don't already have this enabled, you'll need to turn it on before installing WSL2. As already stated, WSL2 is a tiny virtual machine, so Windows needs to be prepared for that. If you have this enabled already, skip and go straight to rebooting your PC to make sure you're ready to install. The quickest way to do it is in PowerShell. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter this command: dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart Now reboot your PC and move to the next section. Downloading and installing WSL2 The next part takes only a couple of steps. Download the WSL2 Kernel update. Run the installer. When prompted for elevated permissions, click yes. Once the installer has done its thing, you'll now have WSL2 successfully installed on your PC. Setting WSL2 for your Linux distros The good thing about WSL2 is that it doesn't replace WSL. It just runs alongside it. This means you can run Linux installs with a combination of different versions. You're able to set either as default as well as setting a version specifically to each Linux distro you have on your PC. Let's break down some of the key commands to use in PowerShell that you'll need to know. Setting WSL2 as default WSL2WSL2Source: Windows Central If you want everything to run on WSL2 as soon as you install it, you can set it as the default version. wsl --set-default-version 2 Listing installed Linux distros and their WSL version WSL2WSL2Source: Windows Central With WSL2 set as default, any Linux installs after that will use it automatically. You can easily check which version of WSL your installed Linux distros are using. wsl --list --verbose Using the verbose flag will give you the breakdown of which version of WSL is attached to which Linux installation. Without it, you'll simply get a list of the versions of Linux you have installed. Changing the version of WSL per Linux installation WSL2WSL2Source: Windows Central While setting WSL2 as default will apply it to anything you install afterward. If you're already set up, you'll need to manually convert. Likewise, if you wish to go between versions 1 and 2 or run a mixture on your system, you can do that. wsl --set-version &lt;distribution name&gt; &lt;versionNumber&gt; So, as an example, if you have a Debian installation on WSL that you need to convert to WSL2, you'd enter wsl --set-version debian 2. Launch specific Linux installations in PowerShell WSL2WSL2Source: Windows Central If you only have one version of Linux installed, simply typing wsl in PowerShell will launch you into the associated bash shell. But if you have multiple, you can launch a specific distro with this command. wsl -d &lt;distribution name&gt; Once you're done, typing exit will take you back into PowerShell. From here on out, you're ready to go forth and install all the Linux you want. Our full guide will help you along the way, but once WSL2 is set up how you like it, it just fades into the background. It's also worth grabbing the Windows Terminal app from the Microsoft Store if you're using WSL. While you can just use the standard terminal installed with each or launch through PowerShell as shown above, Windows Terminal has a neat tabbed interface that lets you run multiple shells at once. Have PowerShell, Linux, Azure Cloud Shell, even Command Prompt, all open together side-by-side in one window. Fancy terminal Windows TerminalWindows Terminal Windows Terminal Microsoft's new modern, open-source terminal application. Whether you're into theming or just want to run a bunch of different shells side-by-side, the Windows Terminal application can do it all.

Tue Oct 27, 2020 3:26am Reply Richard Devine Richard Devine Aye there's a workaround you can employ for now that essentially involves installing xfce and using the built in rdp software on Windows 10 to run a full Linux desktop, but it's definitely coming along officially. Tue Oct 27, 2020 5:43am Reply coocooman3 coocooman3 There's a well rated free app on the Microsoft Store called GWSL that seems to automate everything. Haven't tried it though. And several others with mixed reviews claiming similar capabilities. Tue Oct 27, 2020 10:32pm Reply coocooman3 coocooman3 It's actively being worked on right now, and Microsoft showed off a preview last month at the XDC (X Developers Conference I think?) last month. Don't know if links are allowed, but you can find it here (with timestamp): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2mnbyRgXkY&amp;t=7980s Can't remember from the video if there's a projected release date/when it comes to insider builds if it's not there already. Tue Oct 27, 2020 3:25am Reply blahism blahism It's available now with WSLg in the latest insider builds, hope it hits GA soon. It's pretty slick!

Find, Download, and Update AppImages Quickly with this Neat Tool By Joey Sneddon · Updated 22 December 2021 AppImage Pool app on Ubuntu Tweet Post Share Send 0 If you a fan of AppImages and want a ‘centralised’ way to find, download, and update them, check out AppImage Pool. This open source app is built using Dart and Flutter (now Ubuntu’s toolkit of choice) and it’s kind of like a one-shop app store for finding and downloading App Images on Linux. I say kind of because AppImage Pool is a well-made frontend to the AppImage Hub. While that hub is a popular end-point for many AppImages, the packaging format’s free-roaming nature means distribution isn’t exclusive to any one place (so not every app every released as an AppImage is going to be on it). Also, I’m not going inflict any proselytising about which app format(s) you should or shouldn’t use. That’s never been my style; use what vibes for you and ignore whatever doesn’t. If you only like to use AppImages? Have at it! But back to this app. a screenshot of AppImage Pool running on Ubuntu 21.10An eye-catching carousel greets you AppImage Pool is pitched by its creators as a “simple, modern AppImageHub Client, powered by Flutter”. It boasts the following feature set: Homepage with featured apps carousel Browse based on categories Search Upgrade and Downgrade appimages Version History and multi-dowload support The decision to create this app in Flutter is an interesting choice. Outside of Ubuntu’s new installer (and a few hokey demo apps) this is the first real-world example of a Flutter app being made specifically for Linux (rather than other Ones and happens to also run on Linux). I have reservations about how “native” Flutter apps on Linux can be. While AppImage Pool does an excellent job of looking like it fits there are areas where the rawness of Flutter on Linux is apparent. But none of that detracts from this being a tool that does what it sets out to. It is a great way to explore the variety of apps available in the app image format. a screenshot of AppImages running on Ubuntu 21.10Managing apps is easy Want to try it out? You can install AppImage Pool from Flathub, or download it as (naturally) a standalone AppImage from Github (which is how I tried it). If you chose the standalone root do remember that, once the download is complete, you will need to give the file permission to run before it does anything. Let me know what you think of this app, and the amiable AppImage format in general, down in the comments!

OSS。 在这些例子中，我将使用 Arch Linux 作为参考。然而，这些行为与那些大量采用传统软件包格式的发行版是一致的。 Nix 不使用容器，它也不是一种容器格式。但为了简单起见，我暂时把它称为一种容器格式。 根本问题 图片来源：来自 Unsplash 的 Jackson Simmer 大多数（或许不是全部）大量采用传统软件包格式的发行版都有这个共同的问题：它们都没有利用容器或其他方便的方法来分离依赖关系。用通俗的话说，容器是一个盒子，我们可以把东西放在里面，在不影响主系统（主机）的情况下单独使用它们。 容器通常不会影响“盒子”外的任何东西。并且它们是可移植的，因为它们可以安装在其他发行版上，同时提供一致的体验。利用容器的包管理器会将每个软件包安装在不同的容器中，这提供了一个额外的安全层。这给了开发者更多的控制权和灵活性，他们可以决定在软件包内捆绑什么。 传统的软件包格式产生了一些问题，比如依赖性和包的冲突，这些问题通常需要解决，而不同的发行版有不同的解决办法。 依赖性和软件包的冲突 如果我们试图安装 Visual Studio Code（visual-studio-code-bin），而 Code - OSS（code） 已经安装在 Arch Linux 上，我们会遇到这个问题： $ paru -S visual-studio-code-bin [...] :: Conflicts found: visual-studio-code-bin: code :: Conflicting packages will have to be confirmed manually Aur (1) Old Version New Version Make Only aur/visual-studio-code-bin 1.70.1-1 No 这就是所谓的软件包冲突，即两个或多个软件包不能共存。在这种情况下，我们不能同时安装 Visual Studio Code 和 Code - OSS。 当两个应用程序或软件包提供相同的文件，具有相同的名称，并被放置在同一目录下，那么它们实际上是不能共存的，因为这些文件会发生冲突。在这个例子中，Visual Studio Code 和 Code - OSS 都提供了一个名为 code 的文件，它们都被放在 /usr/bin 中。Visual Studio Code 提供的 code 文件用于启动 Visual Studio Code，而 Code - OSS 的 code 文件则用于启动 Code - OSS。 虽然这个例子只展示了 Visual Studio Code 和 Code - OSS，但这种情况经常发生在不同的应用程序、库和其他软件中。 无法选择依赖项 图片来源：来自 Unsplash 的 Priscilla Du Preez 传统软件包格式的最大问题之一是，打包者不能选择依赖项。 例如，如果一个应用程序最近更新，需要依赖版本 1 的程序 A，但发行版只提供了版本 0.9 的程序 A，那么对于升级该应用程序来说就不太理想，因为发行版无法满足要求。这意味着打包者将不得不暂缓打包，直到该发行版发布新的依赖项，或者采用变通的方法。 同样，如果一个应用程序需要依赖 0.8.1 版本的程序 A，但发行版却只提供了 0.9 版本的程序 A，那么这个应用程序就会表现失常，甚至完全不能运行。 带补丁的库和编译配置 为了扩展，一些应用程序需要带补丁的库或额外的编译配置才能正常运行。例如，OBS Studio 需要一个 打了补丁的 FFmpeg 来与 OBS Studio 更好地整合。 在传统的软件包格式下，一次只能安装一个依赖项的变体。如果发行版提供的是未打过补丁的 FFmpeg，那么就没有办法安装打过补丁的 FFmpeg，除非打包者能解决这个问题。如果安装了打过补丁的 FFmpeg，但另一个程序高度依赖未打过补丁的 FFmpeg、打过其他补丁的 FFmpeg、内置或删除了其他功能的 FFmpeg，那么其他程序就会出现 bug。 现代应用程序本质上是脆弱的。依赖关系树中的一个小错误或不一致，就会导致应用程序的 bug，使用户体验恶化，甚至会让人觉得是应用程序的问题，而不是软件包本身的问题，这就会妨碍应用程序的声誉。 变通方法 让我们看看目前开发者用来打包应用程序的变通方法： 第一种解决方法是在不同的目录中安装依赖库。例如，Electron 是一个巨大的框架，开发者用它来构建应用程序，然后将它们捆绑起来。然而，基于 Electron 的应用程序是不同的，因为它们是建立在不同版本的 Electron 之上的。Discord 捆绑了 Electron 13，而 Element 捆绑了 Electron 19。对于 Arch Linux 上的 Electron 打包，某些目录需要安装在 /opt/APPLICATION_NAME 中，所以这些 Electron 版本 不会相互冲突。 第二种解决方法是篡改应用程序。例如，给应用程序打上补丁，使其在没有某些依赖库或功能的情况下编译，这可以使应用程序成功编译，但不能保证该应用程序能够启动或按预期工作。 第三种解决方法是在编译应用程序时禁用许多编译选项，这也可能禁用一些功能。例如，在 Arch Linux 上，OBS Studio 在编译时禁用了许多基本功能，这 导致了不合格的体验。 这些解决方法因人而异，有些会限制应用程序的功能，有些会引入稳定性问题等等。 不一致的体验 图片来源：来自 Unsplash 的 alevision.co 虽然这些技术限制在整个传统软件包格式中是一致的，但用户体验往往不是这样。由于软件包的发布方式，发行模式与传统软件包格式相结合会影响用户体验。 一些发行版，如 Arch Linux，接近于开发版，因此有最新版本的软件包。然而 Debian 和 Ubuntu LTS 是 LTS 长期支持版，所以它们的很多软件包都落后几个版本。同时，Fedora Linux 和 Ubuntu 稳定版处于 Debian / Ubuntu LTS 和 Arch Linux 之间。 一些软件包格式喜欢尽可能少地给软件包打补丁，以保持它们最接近原版；而另一些格式打补丁是为了增加更多的功能，使用旧库或进行其他类型的更改，以改善用户体验。一些格式喜欢使软件更加轻量化；而另一些格式更喜欢尽可能地添加更多内置功能。软件包有各种各样的习惯和偏好。 正如我们所看到的，一个应用程序在不同的发行版中的构建方式非常不同。此外，不同的发行版的依赖关系也是不同的。传统软件包格式的许多技术限制需要根据发行模式和打包策略采取不同的解决方法。这些微小的变化往往给用户带来不完整的、不合格的体验和错误的印象。一些应用程序可能在某些发行版上运行得更好，但在其他发行版上运行得很差，而其他一些应用程序则运行得更好。即使一个应用程序在每个发行版上的构建方式不同，但其名称和品牌却保持原样，给用户留下错误的印象。 解决方案 图片来源：来自 Unsplash 的 Riccardo Annandale 如上所述，解决这些问题的方法是使用容器。 容器被设计用来分离系统的几个方面。通过使用容器，打包者可以挑选依赖项而不受主机上的库限制。因此，打包者可以发布最新的、功能完整的软件包，同时保持发行的稳定性。 这一点非常重要，因为这些容器格式可以将应用程序和发行版发挥出最大的作用，而不会对系统造成破坏性的影响。 Nix 和 Flatpak Nix 是一个跨平台的包管理器，可以在类 Unix 操作系统中运行，如 Linux 发行版、BSD 和 macOS。Nix 有几个 通道（分支）供用户使用。 另一方面，Flatpak 是一个用于 Linux 桌面的通用软件包格式，它也利用容器，但另外还有沙盒来隔离它们。它旨在以后可以供普通人使用，并被设计为与软件商店（如 GNOME “软件” 和 KDE “发现）集成。换句话说，Flatpak 更像是发行版的一个扩展，而不是一个软件包格式的替代品，因为它的设计初衷不是为了取代系统包管理器。 如果使用 NixOS 等发行版，Nix 也可以作为一种扩展或单独使用。 类似的应用 Nix 和 Flatpak 解决了传统软件包格式的许多基本问题。由于应用程序的分离，这些格式可以安装类似的应用程序，如 Visual Studio Code 和 Code - OSS，而不会冲突。 多个版本 Nix 和 Flatpak 可以安装同一个应用程序的多个版本。使用 Nix，我可以从 nixpkgs-stable（LTS）安装应用程序，同时也可以从 nixpkgs-unstable（开发版）安装同一个应用程序。 同样地，使用 Flatpak，我可以同时从 stable 和 beta 分支安装应用程序。我可以从更多的途径和分支继续安装同一个应用程序，而不会遇到冲突。 挑剔的依赖项 图片来源：来自 Unsplash 的 Ish de loyola 此外，打包者可以将应用程序与不同变体的库捆绑在一起，从而有机会启用更多的构建选项，并使用打过补丁或特定版本的库，从而为用户提供完整的体验。 这意味着打包者可以将打了补丁的 FFmpeg 与 OBS Studio 捆绑在一起，只为了用在 OBS Studio 中。如果我在主机上安装了普通的 FFmpeg，那么 OBS Studio 的补丁 FFmpeg 就不会与主机的 FFmpeg 发生干扰或冲突。 各个发行版的环境都是一致的 如上所述，各发行版使用不同的补丁、构建选项和环境构建应用程序。这导致了应用程序的碎片化，每个应用程序的构建方式和工作方式往往不尽相同。由于 Nix 和 Flatpak 是为跨发行版运行而设计的，它们在每个发行版中为应用程序提供一致的环境，前提是发行版提供了 Nix 或 Flatpak 的支持版本。 缺点 就像所有事物一样，Nix 和 Flatpak 不是完美的。由于最近在 Linux 桌面上容器技术得到了推崇，它们可能为许多应用程序提供了不寻常的环境。 Flatpak 不仅包含了应用程序，还对它们进行沙盒处理。Flatpak 的开发者已经实施了一个短期的变通方案，“在沙盒上打洞”，即所谓的静态权限。他们正在开发适当的长期解决方案，称为 XDG 门户，以解决有关沙盒的许多问题，并使其像 Android 的安全模型一样。 唯一的短期问题是，工具包、框架和应用程序必须采用这些标准。GTK 和 Qt 这样的工具包集成了其中一些门户，但它们也需要时间来集成其他的门户。同时，许多其他的工具箱还没有真正集成任何门户。 工具包、框架和应用程序采用这些新标准是一个时间问题，因为在 XDG 门户之前没有任何适当的标准。应用程序可以直接访问文件系统和 API，所以静态权限保持这种 “标准”。 结论 传统软件包格式的根本问题是它没有利用容器。许多图形化的应用程序本质上是复杂的，需要非常具体的依赖关系才能按预期运行。许多发行版通过使用变通的方法在不同的环境中构建同一个应用程序，例如给应用程序打补丁或禁用某些构建选项。这导致了一个应用程序的不同变体、不一致的行为和不合格的用户体验。 当然，发行版的维护者不可能在几天内现实地重写他们的包管理器并使用容器。这些重写会破坏许多脚本、功能等，而且还需要很长时间才能投入生产环境。 我个人的建议是使用和推广 Flatpak，因为它只是为了扩展现有的发行版，而不是取代它。打包者不必担心打包应用程序，以及诉诸变通的问题，因为 Flatpak 已经在处理这些问题了。 作者 Hari Rana 最初发表于此博客。 Hari 是 Fedora 杂志的 Fedora 编辑委员会的成员。他也是 Fedoea 质量保证（QA）的一员。Hari 希望通过推广各种技术和帮助需要帮助的人，为 Linux 桌面的采用作出贡献。 本文所表达的观点和意见是作者本人的，并不代表我们的观点。 via: https://news.itsfoss.com/traditional-packaging-modern-applications/ 作者：Community 选题：lkxed 译者：gpchn 校对：校对者ID 本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出 发表评论 评论 最新评论 发表评论 [1] 来自北京的 Firefox 104.0|GNU/Linux 用户 发表于 2022-09-14 23:29 的评论： 7 赞 回复 传统的软件包管理的作用不只是让用户安装一个软件，还附带了发行版发布和签名软件包的功能，这意味着通过传统包管理系统发布的包是发行版官方支持，维护者自己构建，并通过签名担保的，如果出了问题可以找到负责的打包人员。 Android的应用市场F-Droid有类似的性质：由F-Droid的服务器构建并签名，为保证信任问题，还提供了可重现构建的方法。和传统包管理不同的是，Android的应用打好包之后应用市场基本上不管理依赖，依赖的问题在打包的时候解决，所以应用市场不是传统的包管理。 传统包管理的一个优点是一个应用的所有依赖都可以通过包 来自北京的 Firefox 104.0|GNU/Linux 用户 2022-09-14 23:37 7 赞 回复 另外容器并不意味着安全，例如 flatkill.org 提到的很多flatpak应用并没隔离主目录。Android除了搞容器化和应用权限之外，还配套了很多安全设施，这个不一定适用于大多数GNU/Linux发行版。 来自巴勒斯坦的 Firefox 104.0|GNU/Linux 用户 2022-09-14 17:59 2 赞 回复 依赖版本不匹配的问题确实非常头痛。 来自广东韶关的 Firefox 105.0|GNU/Linux 用户 2022-09-14 14:26 2 赞 回复 用 nix 装系统，用 flatpak 装应用，用 appimage 预览应用，除了学习成本高，占用空间多，效率较低等问题，好像也不错。 译自：news.itsfoss.com 作者： Hari Rana 原创：LCTT https://linux.cn/article-15027-1.html 译者： gpchn 本文由 LCTT 原创翻译，Linux 中国首发。也想加入译者行列，为开源做一些自己的贡献么？欢迎加入 LCTT！ 翻译工作和译文发表仅用于学习和交流目的，翻译工作遵照 CC-BY-SA 协议规定，如果我们的工作有侵犯到您的权益，请及时联系我们。 欢迎遵照 CC-BY-SA 协议规定 转载，敬请在正文中标注并保留原文/译文链接和作者/译者等信息。 文章仅代表作者的知识和看法，如有不同观点，请楼下排队吐槽 :D 上一篇：Unix 历史：一个伟大作品的诞生下一篇：Linus Torvalds 谈工作与生活、Rust 和他的 M2 MacBook Air LCTT 译者 gpchn 🌟🌟 共计翻译： 6.0 篇 | 共计贡献： 158 天 贡献时间：2022-09-11 -&gt; 2023-02-16 访问我的 LCTT 主页 | 在 GitHub 上关注我 相关阅读 Linux 中国 © 2003 -

And again. And again. And again. And again... 太空堡垒卡拉狄加终极无剧透观影顺序指南 The Ultimate Battlestar Galactica Spoiler Free Viewing Order 注 : 本指南对应从 2003 年开始上映的新版太空堡垒卡拉狄加系列， 为系列的重制版，有始有终，不需要从 1978 年原版开始看起。 一、The Miniseries ( 迷你剧 )（2003） 迷你剧海报 这才是这部剧真正的起点。第一季的内容是在这之后，分为上和下两部分，连起来看就是一部 180 分钟左右的电影。 1. Night 1 2. Night 2 二、Season 1 ( 第一季 )（2004） 迷你剧之后进入正剧，本季总共 13 集，没有加长版，按顺序看即可。 1. 33 2. water 3. Bastille Day 4. Act of Contrition 5. You Can't Go Home Again 6. Litmus 7. Six Degrees of Separation 8. Flesh and Bone 9. Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down 10. The Hand of God 11. Colonial Day 12. Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part I 13. Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part II 三、Season 2 ( 第二季 )（2005） S2 S2 第一季之后进入第二季。本季总共 20 集，需要注意的地方已加粗，在 17 集后有个乍看之下很麻烦的东西。 1. Scattered 2. Valley of Darkness 3. Fragged 4. Resistance 5. The Farm 6. Home, Part I 7. Home, Part II 8. Final Cut 9. Fight of the Phoenix 10. Pegasus ( Extended Version ) 一定要是加长版 , 56 分钟左右 11. Resurretion Ship, Part I 12. Resurrection Ship, Part II 13. Epiphanies 14. Black Market 15. Scar 16. Sacrifice 17. The Captain's Hand Battlestar Galactica Razor (2007) ( 利刃 , 电影 , 加长版 , 大约 101 分钟 , 不需要 81 分钟电视版 ) 重点来了 ! 这部电影其实是在第四季播出之前才上映的，但是按照时间线应该放在这里看，可事情没有这么简单：这部电影的最后 10 分钟有几句台词是为第四季做的准备，如果在这里听到了那几句台词 , 虽然算不上剧透，但是会影响这之后的感受，特别是第三季。 之所以最终决定要将这部电影放在这里看，是因为这部电影发生的事情在第三季之后已经是很遥远的记忆了。如果放在第三季之后看的话，这部电影几乎所有的亮点都不会那么容易的感受到，而且对第四季即将发生的事情并没有什么帮助。 于是就有了这么一个方法，既可以将这部电影的乐趣最大化，又可以避免在第四季前知道一些关键事情。个人强烈建议按照这个方法观看这部电影，并不复杂。 方法： 在那几句台词出现之前关闭声音和字幕，你只会看见画面上的人物在说话，但是你不会知道他们说的是什么。这几句台词过了之后再把声音和字幕打开即可。 这样你会完整的享受完整个电影的故事，直到看完第三季后再回来听这几句台词即可，这几句台词发生在最后的 10 分钟里面（不算制作人员名单），所以你可以安心放心的看前 90 分钟。总共只有两处需要关闭声音和字幕，会在不剧透的前提下给予提示。 第一处：当 Hybrid 用手抓住 Shaw 的时候立即关闭声音和字幕（Hybrid 可能翻译为混合体 , Shaw 可能翻译为肖），当 Hybrid 放手后即可打开声音和字幕。 第二处 : 在第一处后不久 , 当 Red One 开始与总部联系的时候 ( Red One 可能翻译为红一号 ) , 你会听见 Red One 说 &quot;Actual, This is Red One, Come in&quot;, 在这里即可关闭声音和字幕 . 在红一号再次出现在画面上时即可打开声音和字幕 . ( 其实在这之前就可以了 , 不过实在是没有其他的线索可提供 ) 好了，你需要注意的就是这两个小地方，实施起来真心不复杂。即使是你不小心知道了那几句台词的内容也不算是一个剧透，只是会影响这之后的心情而已。如果你不想在不该知道一些事情的时候知道一些事情，那么就按照上述的方法去做即可。 可选项 : Razor Flashbacks(2007) ( 利刃 闪回 , 网络剧 , 共 7 集 , 7 集总时长 18 分钟左右 ) 之所以是可选项是因为这部所谓网络剧其实就是 Razor 电影的删减片段，有 1 到 7 的合集版。其中 4 个部分已经添加到加长版中，剩下的 3 个未加入电影的片段为 1、2、7，这 7 集连起来是一个完整的故事，有兴趣的话可以完整看一遍。 接下来把第二季看完即可。 18. Downloaded 19. Lay Down Your Burdens, Part I 20. Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II 可选项：The Resistance (2006) ( 抵抗 , 网络剧 , 共 10 集 , 10 集总时长 25 分钟左右 ) 这部网络剧的作用是连接第二季和第三季，有 1 到 10 的合集版，十分推荐。 四、Season 3 ( 第三季 )（2006） S3 本季总共 20 集 , 有一集加长版 , 按顺序看即可 . 1. Occupation 2. Precipice 3. Exodus, Part I 4. Exodus, Part II 5. Collaborators 6. Torn 7. A Measure of Salvation 8. Hero 9. Unfinished Business ( Extended Version ) 70 分钟左右加长版 10. The Passage 11. The Eye of Jupiter 12. Rapture 13. Taking a Break From All Your Worries 14. The Woman King 15. A Day in the Life 16. Dirty Hands 17. Maelstrom 18. The Son Also Rises 19. Crossroads, Part I 20. Crossroads, Part II 利刃未分级加长版蓝光封面 上一季的 Razor（静音部分） 是的，你现在可以去看那最后十分钟里面静音掉的台词了。这里也是本来这部电影上映的时期，如果可以的话可以看看这十分钟之前的一些内容，重新听听 Hybrid 之前说的那些话，你会十分惊讶你现在居然能够明白这些话的意思了。 五、Season 4 ( 第四季 )（2008） S4.0 这一季分为两部分，前部分为 10 集，无加长版，按顺序看即可，后半部分之后详细说明。 1. He That Believeth In Me 2. Six of One 3. The Ties That Bind 4. Escape Velocity 5. The Road Less Traveled 6. Faith 7. Guess What's Coming to Dinner 8. Sine Qua Non 9. The Hub 10. Revelations 六、Season 4 Continued ( 第四季后半 , 4.5 季 , 最终季 ) 第四季后半部分有大量的需要注意的地方，顺序如下： 11. Sometimes a Great Notion The Face of the Enemy（2008） ( 敌人的面孔 , 网络剧 , 共 10 集 , 10 集总时长 36 分钟左右 ) 这部网络剧十分推荐， 为之后发生的事情做了十分详细的铺垫，有 1-10 集的合集版。 12. A Disquite Follows My Soul ( Extended Version ) 53 分钟左右加长版 13. The Oath 14. Blood on the Scales 15. No Exit Battlestar Galactica: The Plan (2009) ( 计划 , 电影 ) 这部电影本来是在全剧终后上映的，不过放在这里看效果最好。它将前两季用 Cylon 人的视角演绎了一遍，解答了很多问题 ( 比如那个计划到底是什么 ! ) ，让你安心的通向结局。 16. Deadlock 17. Someone to Watch Over Me 18. Islanded In a Stream of Stars ( Extended Version ) 62 分钟左右加长版 19-20-21. Daybreak ( Extended Version ) 加长版 , 总时长 150 分钟左右 . 注意，此处只有 19-20-21 的合集版才是 150 分钟加长版，19 集单独一集，然后 20-21 作为下半部分的版本总时长只有 130 分钟左右。 七、全剧终（正剧部分） 八、太空堡垒卡拉狄加（BSG）之后的衍生作品 Caprica (2009) ( 全一季共 18 集 ) 这部剧的时间线是在 BSG 的前 58 年，很多人把这个剧当做前传放在 BSG 之前看，不过个人不推荐这么做：并不是这部剧不好，其原因是 Caprica 跟 BSG 太不一样了，导致很多人对 BSG 的内容产生了误解。打个比方的话，如果说 BSG 是政治剧的话那么 Caprica 就是家庭剧。有兴趣可以在 BSG 之后看，不过需要注意的是这部剧在第一季之后就被砍了，所以剧情方面是肯定有问题的。 Blood &amp; Chrome (2012)( 电影 ) 这本来是想要作为一部新剧播出的， 但各种原因导致其最终变为了一部电影。时间线在 Caprica 之后 BSG 之前，这部电影里面没有任何 BSG 正剧的剧透，所以任何时候看都没有问题。 目前这部电影有 3 个版本，一个是分为 10 集的电视版 ( 连起来看就是这部电影 ) ，另外两个分别是分级版和未分级版。 后记 虽然在国外有详细的观影指南，但国内我并没能找到类似的东西。个人与本剧的经历说来话长，只是在完整的经历了整个系列的内容后，个人从中得到了治愈，得到了救赎。于是，怀着对这个系列的感激和爱，想要有缘人能够和我一样完整地欣赏这部被大多数人无视已久的剧，写下了这篇中文版的观影攻略。 在好友的推荐下决定将这篇文章发在机核，虽然不太清楚这里的规矩是什么，但是对个人而言欢迎转载，不需要记名，只希望更多的人能够看见。这部剧并不是没有缺点，并不是完美无瑕，个人也不会在这里做这部剧的评测。除了给予这部剧一个我心中永恒的地位，并强烈推荐给所有人以外，我也不会在这里再多安利什么。 如果你之前由于各种原因错过了或者放弃了这部剧的话，可以考虑按照本攻略再次踏上观影旅程。衷心希望你能和我一样，拥有一段难忘的观影记忆，也希望能够让机核的更多朋友们了解这部作品。 " />

                   NS1:content=" Skip to content Reviews from My Couch Facebook New Releases Movies Television Books Comic Books Zones Lists and Rankings Year in Review Site Info The 10 best short stories in ‘The X-Files: The Truth is Out There’ (Book review) May 5, 2016April 16, 2021 John Hansen “The Truth is Out There,” the February follow-up to last year’s “Trust No One,” serves up another mixed bag of “X-Files” short stories that’s on par with the first collection. It’s not “The X-Files” at its finest, but it’s a fun assortment that will tide fans over between comic installments. The biggest improvement in Volume 2 is in the line editing; there are probably 90 percent fewer typos and grammatical errors. However, the continuity problems are more prevalent. This book is from comic publisher IDW, and it says so prominently on the spine, but an introductory note explaining that these stories are part of the IDW comics continuity would have helped. (The comics continuity and TV continuity branch off in 2013. In the comics continuity, Mulder and Scully rejoin the X-Files, they are still a happy couple and the Lone Gunmen are revealed to be alive. In the TV continuity, M&amp;S rejoin the X-Files in 2016, they are separated and the Gunmen have not been revealed to be alive. Further confusing matters, a comic series based on the TV continuity launches this month.) At least one continuity mistake is completely inexcusable: In Hank Schwaeble’s “Male Privilege,” the agents investigate an X-File in 2006, which is during the period when they were not only off the X-Files, but also the X-Files were closed and M&amp;S were keeping their distance from the FBI as much as possible. Still, there are some fun ideas explored among these 15 short stories. Here are my picks for the 10 best: 1. “Black Hole Son” by Kami Garcia (1977, Massachusetts) – The short-story anthologies (and comics, for that matter) need to produce more stories like this one, which tells of a teenage Fox Mulder digging into his sister’s disappearance. The surprising highlight is his crush on his best friend, Phoebe (not to be confused with Phoebe Green from Season 1’s “Fire,” although it does show that Mulder has a thing for girls named Phoebe). 2. “XXX” by Glenn Greenberg (1999, California) – Especially toward the later seasons, “The X-Files” began to find a layer of winky humor amid serious stories of bizarre and gruesome deaths. Remarkably, the show never really went all-in with an episode having fun with Mulder’s porn addiction, but Greenberg makes up for it here as M&amp;S investigate a case involving Mulder’s favorite adult-film actress. 3. “Heart” by Kendare Blake (1995, New Jersey) – The Topps comics briefly touched on the idea of strange connections between organ donors and their recipients in Issue 23, “Donor.” This yarn is a meatier character piece as we get into the head of a quiet old man named Arthur who gradually takes on the decidedly different traits of the murder victim from whom he received a heart. 4. “Mummiya” by Greg Cox (1996, Washington) – Cox, the author of some “Terminator” novels, tells an effectively creepy tale about a terminal patient who attempts to mummify and resurrect herself via ancient magic – somewhat in the vein of Season 4’s “Kaddish” — with a nice twist at the end. All 9 ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ films, ranked Elsewhere on RFMC All 9 ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ films, ranked 5. “Voice of Experience” by Rachel Caine (1993, Washington, D.C.) – This story features a villain who mesmerizes people and drains their emotions by making eye contact with them, which is the perfect type of character for the written word rather than for TV. The way Mulder finds clues through the villain’s work as a professional novelist is also a fun concept. 6. “Dead Ringer” by Kelly Armstrong (1993, Pennsylvania) – Mulder and Scully discover corpses that are genetic matches to people who are still alive, something that feels like a vintage X-File. The concept of faeries deviates a bit from the premise, as “The X-Files” doesn’t delve into mystical creatures too often. But the idea of beings who take over the lives of murder victims to help the families is intriguingly bittersweet. 7. “Snowman” by Sarah Stegall (2001, Washington) – Agent Doggett is usually ignored in IDW’s work, so Stegall gets bonus points for featuring him. As Mulder joins the adventure, this ends up being a decent exploration of both the Abominable Snowman legend and a scary military experiment. The only misfire is that Stegall makes Doggett too much of a skeptic, as he had already experienced a season’s worth of X-Files as Scully’s partner at this point. 8. “Drive Time” by John McGoran (2016, Massachusetts) – McGoran delivers a mind-bending time-travel story that calls to mind Season 4’s similarly weird-science-based “Synchrony.” The yarn would also sit well in the “Terminator” universe, particularly the over-the-top conclusion where multiple versions of the time traveler wink out of existence every time an older version of the time traveler is killed. 9. “We Should Listen to Some Shostakovich” by Hank Phillippi Ryan (2017, Washington, D.C.) – The mystery centered on clues hidden in a series of paintings doesn’t play as well with the written word as it would visually, but this is a remarkable entry for another reason: It’s chronologically the last story in the IDW comics timeline, and it provides some major details. Scully’s mom (who died in the TV miniseries) is still alive and well, M&amp;S move into a new house, and they have another baby, named Allie. 10. “Pilot” by David Liss (1996, Washington, D.C.) – Liss gets meta with “The X-Files” as M&amp;S are introduced to an alternate universe where they aren’t real people, but rather characters on a TV show. It doesn’t work as well as, say, Season 7’s “Hollywood A.D.” – where the agents’ lives are portrayed in a show-within-the-show – but it’s still an entertaining attempt.

Ritchie合作发明了UNIX操作系统，同时Dennis M. Ritchie为了解决UNIX系统的移植性问题而发明了C语言，贝尔实验室的UNIX和C语言两大发明奠定了整个现代IT行业最重要的软件基础（目前的三大桌面操作系统的中Linux和Mac OS X都是源于UNIX系统，两大移动平台的操作系统iOS和Android也都是源于UNIX系统。C系家族的编程语言占据统治地位达几十年之久）。在UNIX和C语言发明40年之后，目前已经在Google工作的Ken Thompson和Rob Pike（他们在贝尔实验室时就是同事）、还有Robert Griesemer（设计了V8引擎和HotSpot虚拟机）一起合作，为了解决在21世纪多核和网络化环境下越来越复杂的编程问题而发明了Go语言。从Go语言库早期代码库日志可以看出它的演化历程（Git用git log --before={2008-03-03} --reverse命令查看）： 从早期提交日志中也可以看出，Go语言是从Ken Thompson发明的B语言、Dennis M. Ritchie发明的C语言逐步演化过来的，是C语言家族的成员，因此很多人将Go语言称为21世纪的C语言。纵观这几年来的发展趋势，Go语言已经成为云计算、云存储时代最重要的基础编程语言。 在C语言发明之后约5年的时间之后（1978年），Brian W. Kernighan和Dennis M. Ritchie合作编写出版了C语言方面的经典教材《The C Programming Language》，该书被誉为C语言程序员的圣经，作者也被大家亲切地称为K&amp;R。同样在Go语言正式发布（2009年）约5年之后（2014年开始写作，2015年出版），由Go语言核心团队成员Alan A. A. Donovan和K&amp;R中的Brian W. Kernighan合作编写了Go语言方面的经典教材《The Go Programming Language》。Go语言被誉为21世纪的C语言，如果说K&amp;R所著的是圣经的旧约，那么D&amp;K所著的必将成为圣经的新约。该书介绍了Go语言几乎全部特性，并且随着语言的深入层层递进，对每个细节都解读得非常细致，每一节内容都精彩不容错过，是广大Gopher的必读书目。大部分Go语言核心团队的成员都参与了该书校对工作，因此该书的质量是可以完全放心的。 同时，单凭阅读和学习其语法结构并不能真正地掌握一门编程语言，必须进行足够多的编程实践——亲自编写一些程序并研究学习别人写的程序。要从利用Go语言良好的特性使得程序模块化，充分利用Go的标准函数库以Go语言自己的风格来编写程序。书中包含了上百个精心挑选的习题，希望大家能先用自己的方式尝试完成习题，然后再参考官方给出的解决方案。 该书英文版约从2015年10月开始公开发售，其中日文版本最早参与翻译和审校（参考致谢部分）。在2015年10月，我们并不知道中文版是否会及时引进、将由哪家出版社引进、引进将由何人来翻译、何时能出版，这些信息都成了一个秘密。中国的Go语言社区是全球最大的Go语言社区，我们从一开始就始终紧跟着Go语言的发展脚步。我们应该也完全有能力以中国Go语言社区的力量同步完成Go语言圣经中文版的翻译工作。与此同时，国内有很多Go语言爱好者也在积极关注该书（本人也在第一时间购买了纸质版本，亚马逊价格314人民币。补充：国内也即将出版英文版，价格79元）。为了Go语言的学习和交流，大家决定合作免费翻译该书。 翻译工作从2015年11月20日前后开始，到2016年1月底初步完成，前后历时约2个月时间（在其它语言版本中，全球第一个完成翻译的，基本做到和原版同步）。其中，chai2010翻译了前言、第2 ~ 4章、第10 ~ 13章，Xargin翻译了第1章、第6章、第8 ~ 9章，CrazySssst翻译了第5章，foreversmart翻译了第7章，大家共同参与了基本的校验工作，还有其他一些朋友提供了积极的反馈建议。如果大家还有任何问题或建议，可以直接到中文版项目页面提交Issue，如果发现英文版原文在勘误中未提到的任何错误，可以直接去英文版项目提交。 最后，希望这本书能够帮助大家用Go语言快乐地编程。 2016年 1月 于 武汉 前言 “Go是一个开源的编程语言，它很容易用于构建简单、可靠和高效的软件。”（摘自Go语言官方网站：http://golang.org ） Go语言由来自Google公司的Robert Griesemer，Rob Pike和Ken Thompson三位大牛于2007年9月开始设计和实现，然后于2009年的11月对外正式发布（译注：关于Go语言的创世纪过程请参考 http://talks.golang.org/2015/how-go-was-made.slide ）。语言及其配套工具的设计目标是具有表达力，高效的编译和执行效率，有效地编写高效和健壮的程序。 Go语言有着和C语言类似的语法外表，和C语言一样是专业程序员的必备工具，可以用最小的代价获得最大的战果。 但是它不仅仅是一个更新的C语言。它还从其他语言借鉴了很多好的想法，同时避免引入过度的复杂性。 Go语言中和并发编程相关的特性是全新的也是有效的，同时对数据抽象和面向对象编程的支持也很灵活。 Go语言同时还集成了自动垃圾收集技术用于更好地管理内存。 Go语言尤其适合编写网络服务相关基础设施，同时也适合开发一些工具软件和系统软件。 但是Go语言确实是一个通用的编程语言，它也可以用在图形图像驱动编程、移动应用程序开发 和机器学习等诸多领域。目前Go语言已经成为受欢迎的作为无类型的脚本语言的替代者： 因为Go编写的程序通常比脚本语言运行的更快也更安全，而且很少会发生意外的类型错误。 Go语言还是一个开源的项目，可以免费获取编译器、库、配套工具的源代码。 Go语言的贡献者来自一个活跃的全球社区。Go语言可以运行在类UNIX系统—— 比如Linux、FreeBSD、OpenBSD、Mac OSX——和Plan9系统和Microsoft Windows操作系统之上。 Go语言编写的程序无需修改就可以运行在上面这些环境。 本书是为了帮助你开始以有效的方式使用Go语言，充分利用语言本身的特性和自带的标准库去编写清晰地道的Go程序。 交流学习 如果有疑问或想和我交流，欢迎扫码下方二维码 polarisxu polarisxu gopherstudio gopherstudio " />

Shannon McMahon.jpg Shannon McMahon, a female super-soldier. Super-soldiers are human replacements that look human but are actually a type of alien. Fearless and virtually unstoppable, these aliens are not directed by anyone and are answerable to no-one except their own biological imperative to survive. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;) They want to knock out any and all attempts by humans to survive the alien colonization of Earth and were created to aid in the extraterrestrial repopulation of the planet. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Existence&quot;) Their collective name, &quot;super-soldiers,&quot; derives from the aliens themselves, but was often used cynically by humans.

These included Knowle Rohrer and Shannon McMahon, both of whom served with Bravo Company, in the United States Marine Corps. (TXF: &quot;Three Words&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, et al.) According to a deceptive Shannon McMahon in late 2001, she and Knowle Rohrer had been drafted right out of Bravo Company together and had been &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;, the prototypes of a military science program that had begun fifty years prior to 2001. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Super-soldiers in Iraq.jpg During the Gulf War, super-soldiers serve the United States of America. Super-soldiers were originally deployed during the Gulf War. On February 26, 1991, Zeke Josepho was leading a team of soldiers in Iraq when they were ambushed by Saddam Hussein's forces and all of Josepho's team was killed except for himself. He then witnessed four soldiers wearing American uniforms obliterate the holed-in enemy and survive gunshots as well as an explosion. Stunned by this experience, Josepho interpreted not only these particular super-soldiers as having been angels but subsequently also thought of the super-soldiers in general as &quot;the true sons of God.&quot; (TXF: &quot;Providence&quot;) Abduction, Infection, Return, and Transformation About ten years later, certain abductees were collectively taken in 2000 and were individually returned in 2001, with each of their bodies prepared for undergoing the transformation into a super-soldier. (TXF: &quot;Requiem&quot;, &quot;DeadAlive&quot;) Several of these individuals were prevented from transforming, however, including FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and, presumably, Theresa Hoese. (TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;, &quot;This is Not Happening&quot;) At least one of these abductees, Billy Miles, did undergo the full transformation. (TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;) The proposed Super-Soldier is abducted and placed in the Testing room. Horrific procedures are performed on them, including holes being drilled in their soft palate, as well as having their chest cut open and organ tissue removed. After considerable time aboard the craft, the Colonists infect them with the alien virus. Later in 2001, Agent Mulder came to the conclusion that specific data - information that was highly sought after, extremely well protected and stored in the US Census Bureau - pertained to certain individuals, each of whom had been targeted, due to their genetic profile, for abduction and subsequent replacement by a super-soldier. Knowle Rohrer had been replaced by a super-soldier, by about this point. (TXF: &quot;Three Words&quot;) It is unclear when exactly Knowle Rohrer became a super-soldier. Before the revelation of him being such an alien at the end of &quot;Three Words&quot;, he appears in previous scenes of that episode as well as in TXF: &quot;Per Manum&quot;, an earlier Season 8 episode. Infiltrating the FBI &amp; Involvement in a Birth Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane.jpg Super-soldiers Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane in 2001. By late 2001, the super-soldiers had infiltrated the FBI; Special Agent Gene Crane had been replaced by a super-soldier, affiliated with the alien Billy Miles and Knowle Rohrer. Super-soldier Billy Miles made several attempts to target Scully, who was pregnant with a baby that Alex Krycek, who was secretly in contact with the alien Knowle Rohrer, claimed the super-soldiers had only recently learned of. Krycek also claimed that the prospect of the child's birth threatened the alien repopulation of Earth and that the super-soldiers feared the child's implications - that it could somehow be greater than them and might be more human than human, implying that there was a God or higher power. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Existence&quot;) Krycek was killed, shortly after making these claims. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) The alien Billy Miles initially killed members of a group (namely, Doctors Lev and Parenti as well as Duffy Haskell), who had been monitoring Scully's pregnancy and had been attempting to create cloned baby human/alien hybrids, work that had originally been supervised and financed by the Syndicate. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;) Shortly thereafter, the alien Knowle Rohrer told Special Agent John Doggett - Scully's current FBI partner and a friend of Rohrer's who had served with him in Bravo Company, USMC, but was unaware of his replacement at the time - that the aliens were actually &quot;super-soldiers&quot;, the result of a rumored program out of the Cold War, of which Billy Miles was a prototype and Scully's unborn baby was the first organic version. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Doggett would later recall to Scully that Rohrer had told him that her pregnancy was the result of a government cloning experiment to create a super-soldier. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;) Soon after Rohrer made these claims, Doggett learned of his duplicity, when the FBI agent saw the alien Rohrer meet with Agent Crane in Deputy Director Alex Krycek's office. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Due to this, Doggett would, soon thereafter, investigate Deputy Director Kersh, but would find nothing incriminating concerning the Deputy Director. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Shortly after Doggett witnessed the two super soldiers meet, he and Assistant Director Walter Skinner were chased by the alien Rohrer and Crane in the parking garage of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, the FBI's Headquarters, apparently causing the death of Crane. Knowle Rohrer was subsequently involved in a crash that resulted in a fire and, seemingly, his death. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) However, evidence of the chase, crash and fire would later be eliminated - the bodies of Rohrer and Crane would go missing and the security tapes, when later checked, showed none of these incidents occurring. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;) Super-soldiers.jpg A group of super-soldiers witness Dana Scully give birth to her baby son, William. While the incidents were taking place, super-soldier Billy Miles witnessed the birth of Scully's baby son in Democrat Hot Springs, Georgia (where Scully had fled from the alien Miles with Special Agent Monica Reyes), along with many other super-soldiers, one of whom had been acting as a Game Warden intent on eliminating Miles and helping Scully. The aliens soon left the area, without taking the baby with them; Mulder later suggested that the only explanation he could think of for this was that the aliens had realized the baby was not what they had thought he was. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Censure of Information By two nights later, Shannon McMahon, now working for the Department of Justice, had been replaced by a super-soldier and had been contacted by Carl Wormus, a high-ranking official for the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as Roland McFarland, a worker in the Greater Maryland Water Reclamation Facility. Both men were in contact with each other, as well as with the Captain of the USS Valor Victory. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Together, they were attempting to alert the FBI about a secret lab aboard the ship, but super-soldiers Shannon McMahon and Knowle Rohrer tried to stop them from doing so. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) By means of drowning, Shannon MacMahon killed both Carl Wormus and Roland McFarland in Baltimore while, between these two deaths taking place, Mulder left for New Mexico, due to the super-soldier threat. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, &quot;The Truth&quot;) Subsequently, Shannon McMahon slyly prevented Scully, Reyes and Doggett from being disciplined by the FBI for involving themselves, without official authorization, in the investigation of the deaths. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Like Knowle Rohrer's earlier claims to Doggett, Shannon McMahon led the agents to believe that she and Rohrer were both genetically engineered soldiers, alike in almost every way except that she hated what she was. She also claimed that the two men she had killed had been part of the program that had created the super-soldiers and that the men had been attempting to prepare the water supply in Maryland, so that the state's population would breed a generation of super-soldiers. According to her, the program had already advanced seven stages from the science that had created her, so far that its members had successfully given birth to a super-soldier from a mutated egg. This seems to be an implied reference to Scully's baby son, William. Meanwhile, aboard the docked Valor Victory, Knowle Rohrer replaced Chief Petty Officer Banford, whose deceased body was later found floating in the water; Rohrer had, presumably, killed Chief Banford, before disposing of his body. He and Reyes then simultaneously discovered that Carl Wormus and the Captain of the Valor Victory had been trying to contact the FBI. Reyes came to the belief that Shannon McMahon was still trying to pinpoint the Captain of the Valor Victory and wanted the agents to lead her to him. After Reyes revealed her findings to Doggett and Scully, the threesome headed to the ship as Rohrer killed the Captain on board the vessel and took his place at a telephone booth on the dock where, following the agents' arrival, they initially thought he was the Captain. Rohrer approached Doggett, as he realized the imposter's true identity, and the two females consequently fled, moments before the alien super-soldier attacked Doggett but was prevented from killing him and rendered almost completely harmless by Shannon McMahon, who was then thwarted by Rohrer in turn and her remains ended up in the sea. Slightly longer than forty-eight hours later, Scully had a dream in which she saw Shannon McMahon regain consciousness on the seabed. Following her and Rohrer's apparently aggressive encounter, the agents boarded the Valor Victory, to find it deserted with a bomb inside, presumably armed by Knowle Rohrer. Scully was able to determine that the ship's lab, which the super-soldiers had ultimately failed to keep secret, housed ova that had been extracted from test subjects and manipulated for transplantation. The agents made a lucky escape from the vessel, mere moments before the bomb aboard detonated. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Dealing with Mulder &amp; Killing Agent Comer Shadow Man.jpg The mysterious Shadow Man. A super-soldier known as the &quot;Shadow Man&quot; had, by January 2002, assumed a supervisory position within the National Security Agency, lying to one of his subordinates that he had learned things about a super-soldier program. In that month, he repeatedly contacted Agents Doggett and Reyes, claiming that he had highly classified military files on the super-soldiers and wanted to give their names exclusively to Mulder. The Shadow Man conducted surveillance on Doggett, Reyes and Scully, observing Scully as he led her alone on an elaborate route to a desolate countryside location, where he met with her. He was extremely careful that she was neither followed nor tracked, even blowing her car up with her clothes and gun inside, and revealed that he knew even the most minute details about her. When asked by Scully who he was, the Shadow Man claimed he was &quot;the future.&quot; His final instruction to her was that she contact Mulder within the next twenty-four hours, which she did shortly thereafter. Scully was waiting for Mulder's return - at a train station, with not only Doggett and Reyes but also the Shadow Man's associate - when the Shadow Man arrived and shot his own subordinate to death. He aimed his gun at Scully but then faced several incidents that would normally kill a human, his survival and the contents of his blood influencing the agents to realize that he was actually a super-soldier. At the bottom of the nearby Manville Rock Quarry, Scully alone was cornered by the Shadow Man, who claimed that either her son or Mulder had to die. She then watched the Shadow Man finally be obliterated, after which she mentioned - in her regular email correspondence with Mulder - that the beings known as super-soldiers could actually be destroyed. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;) The Shadow Man's final words were illuminated for the agents when Special Agent Robert Comer, who had been sent undercover to infiltrate a cult that Josepho now led, told Scully and Reyes of a prophecy that Josepho had claimed God had told him. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;) According to the prophecy and Josepho's interpretation of it, William would try to stop the alien colonization of Earth, except if Mulder was killed. (TXF: &quot;Providence&quot;) So, by wanting either of them dead, the Shadow Man had tried to ensure that William would not hamper colonization. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;) Another super-soldier, the &quot;Toothpick Man&quot;, had meanwhile infiltrated the senior staff of the FBI and was working in league with Deputy Director Kersh. (TXF: &quot;Provenance&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;) The Toothpick Man secretly killed Agent Comer. After AD Follmer later started to discover that Comer had been murdered and therefore wanted to take his own signature off a report concerning the investigation of Comer's death, the Toothpick Man privately assured Kersh that he would take care of the issue regarding the report. (TXF: &quot;Providence&quot;) Allegations Concerning the Super-Soldiers Yves Adele Harlow (2002).jpg Yves Adele Harlow, who was accused of having become a super-soldier. Later in 2002, Morris Fletcher made an elaborate and deceptive attempt to track down Yves Adele Harlow, baiting Agents Doggett and Reyes by telling them that Yves had become a super-soldier. This notion was first dismissed by The Lone Gunmen before the agents - who had been investigating super-soldiers for months - and the Gunmen determined that, although Yves had become a murderer, she had not even heard of the super-soldiers before and her victims were actually terrorists. Fletcher at first claimed he had made a genuine mistake in thinking Yves was a super-soldier but Doggett then discovered evidence that Fletcher had been running a scam on the agents ever since the start of the case. (TXF: &quot;Jump the Shark&quot;) Shortly after these events, - scarred to the point of being unrecognizable - was caught, by Doggett, while attempting to sneak into FBI Headquarters and was then questioned exclusively by Scully, Reyes and Doggett, although he gave them a false name. He told Scully that the reason he had lied about his name was that he feared he would otherwise be killed by the super-soldiers who had infiltrated the FBI. He was also aware that the same super-soldiers would kill Mulder and explained to the agents, &quot;The conspiracy to keep the truth about aliens from the American public, all but destroyed a few years ago, has given rise to a new conspiracy in the government now by men who are alien themselves.&quot; The agents learned of Spender's true identity shortly thereafter and discovered that his intention had been to gain access to William, so that he could normalize the baby's partly-alien biology. (TXF: &quot;William&quot;) In May of the same year, Mulder infiltrated the Mount Weather complex at Bluemont, Virginia but was caught there by super-soldier Knowle Rohrer, who chased and attacked Mulder but was ultimately electrocuted himself. After Mulder was captured by the base's guards, he was accused of the extremely improbable charge of having killed Knowle Rohrer, who Doggett remembered - while in the company of his own associates - as having seemingly been killed before. General Mark A. Suveg ordered Kersh to have Mulder be tried by the FBI in particular, to increase the chances of the verdict being guilty, and Suveg threatened Kersh that he would definitely agree to this as - according to the General - there were now forces inside the government that a man would be foolish to disobey. Shortly before the trial, the prosecution obtained the sworn testimony of thirty government workers (from the Mount Weather complex) who had seen Rohrer be electrocuted, and both Doggett and Reyes were told an obvious lie by the military - that Rohrer's deceased body was at Fort Marlene. Toothpick Man.jpg The Toothpick Man attending Mulder's trial. Meanwhile, the Toothpick Man attended the trial as one of the panelists and the trial included testimony from Marita Covarrubias - who Skinner tried to persuade into admitting that she could prove Rohrer was one of the alien replacements that were being referred to as super-soldiers, but Covarrubias was excused by Mulder, as he feared for the safety of her life. When Gibson Praise was subsequently allowed to present a testimony, he used his ability to read minds in order to identify the Toothpick Man as one of the so-called super-soldiers. Even though Mulder created a disturbance by demanding that the Toothpick Man therefore be removed from the room, the Toothpick Man continued to serve as a panelist. The next individual to testify was Agent Doggett, who first explained that, although he was generally a skeptic, he had witnessed super-soldiers in action and was certain that Mulder could not have killed the virtually invincible Rohrer, but his testimony was put to an end when he was asked whether he subscribed to Mulder's belief that the super-soldiers were aliens. Reyes subsequently presented a testimony, mentioning that the agents had learned William's birth had been all-important to the so-called super-soldiers. Afterwards, Reyes and Doggett managed to arrange the transfer of the body that was purportedly that of Knowle Rohrer, having it be moved to the FBI Academy in Quantico. By matching this corpse to Rohrer's medical records, Scully and Reyes were able to prove that the body was not that of Rohrer, but Mulder was nevertheless sentenced to death. Searching for Mulder and Scully That night, Rohrer went to Mulder's cell only to find that Mulder had escaped so Rohrer began searching for Mulder. The Toothpick Man later answered the door of Kersh's office to Skinner while Doggett, Reyes and Gibson Praise stood nearby. The alien not only informed Skinner that Kersh needed to see him but he also knew that Mulder and Scully had headed to New Mexico; Gibson used his mind-reading ability to detect that the Toothpick Man knew the latter detail. Moments after Reyes and Doggett followed Mulder and Scully to New Mexico, Rohrer confronted them but they then witnessed him finally be destroyed. (TXF: &quot;The Truth&quot;) Aftermath What became of the super-soldiers is unknown. Mulder and Scully returned to help the FBI on a case six years following them going on the run which led to Mulder being pardoned. (TXF: The X-Files: I Want to Believe) Seven years following this, the pair of them returned for duty at the FBI without any problems, seemingly implying that the super-soldiers are no more. (TXF: &quot;My Struggle&quot;) Advertisement Transformation Abduction, Infection &amp; Return Transformation of abductees into super-soldiers was accomplished via infection with an alien virus, which would keep the abductee's body alive, just long enough to undergo the transformation. The infected abductees were often mistaken for having been dead for days or even months and would often display characteristics of being dead, even though they were clinically alive. The characteristics of death might include decomposition of tissue (as well as, presumably, the neural and vascular systems), a postmortem intumescence, tissue necrosis, heartbeat and rate of metabolism slowing to imperceptibility and rigor of the invidual's body. One infected individual set to undergo this transformation had a pulse of 56 bpm while another had a pulse of about 70 bpm. Super Soldier transformation.jpg During one of the final stages of his transformation into a super-soldier in 2001, abductee Billy Miles bloodily sheds his skin in a shower. The final stages of the transformation into a super-soldier were a seizure, during which two heartbeats in the infected abductee could apparently be detected before their pulse returned to normal, and the subsequent bloody sloughing of the skin. (TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;) The transformation into a super-soldier could be prevented with a vaccine against the alien virus responsible for the transformation, or with the healing capabilities of an alien such as Jeremiah Smith. (TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;, &quot;This is Not Happening&quot;) Keeping the infected body connected to life-support machines would incubate the virus and hamper it along, however, and evidence that this was the case could be determined by disconnecting the individual from life-support, causing the person's temperature to drop rapidly without affecting their vital signs. To aid the individual's complete recovery, the person would be administered with a course of transfusions and antivirals. (TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;) Any individuals who had recovered from the infected state of preparation for the transformation into a super-soldier, including those who had been transformed as well as those who had been prevented from transforming, initially had a slight difficulty with walking but were gradually rejuvenated to full health. For example, after Billy Miles recovered, every piece of medical data on him was one hundred percent normal, even though blood, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as loss of brain function, would normally be expected, following the recovery he had apparently undergone. (TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;) Mulder's recovery rendered a neurological disorder he had been suffering from, prior to his abduction, no longer detectable and seemingly caused scars on his face, hands, feet, and chest - wounds from his abduction - to repair themselves. (TXF: &quot;Three Words&quot;) There is some evidence, from TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot;, to suggest that the transformation into a super-soldier might possibly cause confusion and/or loss of memory in an individual who had undergone the transformation. Other Methods In 2001, Shannon McMahon claimed to Agents Doggett, Scully and Reyes that not only had both Carl Wormus and Roland McFarland been preparing Maryland's water supply, as part of a government program, but also that the same program altered the molecular make-up of chloramine before adding it to the water, with the secret intention of priming a population to breed a generation of super-soldiers by adding something to the water that promoted the mutation of offspring, in fertilization and pregnancy. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Jeffrey Spender endures a procedure.jpg is subjected to a failed attempt to turn him into a super-soldier. The following year, Jeffrey Spender revealed that his scarring was due to having been injected by something that had burned throughout his entire body, inside and out, and that this procedure had been a failed attempt to turn him into one of the alien men whose kind were now conspiring within the government. Spender also claimed that the aliens planned to perform the same procedure on everyone else and, even after he came clean about his identity and normalized William's biology, Spender implied that there was a risk the aliens would subject William to this procedure. (TXF: &quot;William&quot;) Features The appearance of a super-soldier's internals are indistinguishable to those of a human, as the two are virtually identical. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) When externally examined by a doctor, a super-soldier would, physically, seem absolutely humanly normal. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) However, there are some features that characterize alien super-soldiers and differentiate them from humans. (TXF: &quot;Three Words&quot;, et al.) Neck Ridges &amp; Metallic Vertebrae Metallic vertebra.jpg A super-soldier's metallic vertebrae. Upon external examination, super-soldiers can only physically be identified by a pair of spinal disc-like protrusions on the backs of their necks. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;, et al.) These physical features are actually the elongated spinous processes of two vertebrae and are, unlike the body's other internals, metallic in composition. When alone outside a super-soldier's body, this component is known to repeatedly spin and stop, replicating itself (with additional vertebrae that join the original component) and multiplying itself by two each time. This vertebra is also apparently capable of reconstituting a seemingly deceased super-soldier's mashed up internals, allowing the alien to be resurrected. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) In late 2001, Shannon McMahon termed this feature &quot;a standard mutation,&quot; while Scully (a medical doctor) later referred to it as &quot;a small deformity of the spine.&quot; (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) The resuscitative ability of this distinctive feature was never shown and was – specifically, in the episode &quot;Existence&quot; – only ever implied. The component appears in TXF: &quot;Three Words&quot; (on Knowle Rohrer), &quot;Essence&quot; (on Billy Miles and Gene Crane), &quot;Existence&quot; (on Billy Miles again and the Game Warden), &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot; (on Shannon McMahon and again on Knowle Rohrer) and &quot;Providence&quot; (on the &quot;Toothpick Man&quot;). Knowle Rohrer's neck.jpg The ridges on Knowle Rohrer's neck in mid-2001 Knowle Rohrer's neck (side).jpg A side view of Knowle Rohrer's neck ridges in mid-2001 Knowle Rohrer's neck deformity.jpg Knowle Rohrer's neck ridges in late 2001 Billy Miles' neck.jpg Billy Miles' neck ridges Bloodied Billy Miles' neck.jpg The neck ridges on a bloodied Billy Miles Gene Crane's neck.jpg Gene Crane's neck ridges Game Warden's neck.jpg The Game Warden's neck ridges Shannon McMahon's neck.jpg Shannon McMahon's neck ridges Toothpick Man's neck.jpg The &quot;Toothpick Man&quot;'s neck ridges Blood &amp; DNA Shadow Man metallicizes.jpg The Shadow Man metallicizes. Knowle Rohrer metallicized.jpg A fully metallic version of Knowle Rohrer. Unlike other alien species, super-soldiers bleed red blood that is neither toxic nor acidic. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, et al.) Their DNA is complexed with iron and is extremely different from human DNA. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;) The super-soldiers have only one definite physical weakness - large amounts of magnetite, an iron compound, exposure to which causes a super-soldier to uncontrollably quiver as its body becomes metallic in appearance before being pulled towards the source of the magnetite at an enormous speed that has often destroyed a super-soldier. This method of destroying a super-soldier was the means of death encountered by both the Shadow Man and Knowle Rohrer. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1, &quot;The Truth&quot;) Injecting a form of magnetite into a person who is part alien will normalize the person's biology but an elevated amount of iron may still be present in the person's blood, after such an injection. (TXF: &quot;William&quot;) Stabbing a super-soldier through its torso with another super-soldier's arm is possibly another means of destroying this type of alien but this possibility would be disproved if Scully's dream of Shannon McMahon regaining consciousness on the seabed, after seemingly being killed by Knowle Rohrer's arm, was accurate. Moreover, Billy Miles' injuries were much more serious than those sustained by Rohrer or McMahon, yet he managed to fully regenerate his body. Physical Abilities Alien super-soldiers possess many physical abilities that humans do not have. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, et al.) In late 2001, Shannon McMahon implied that the super-soldiers did not require any sleep. A super-soldier's body could even continue to function after decapitation. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) In several episodes from the ninth season of The X-Files, Scully's baby son, William, exhibits abilities that are possibly related to those of the alien super-soldiers, as he is suggested as being one of these aliens himself. This possibility is never firmly confirmed nor denied, however, and whether his abilities are indeed related to the super-soldiers' is consequently also unknown. Offensive Capabilities Hand as a Blade Billy Miles' hand cuts through elevator door.jpg As Alex Krycek watches, super-soldier Billy Miles tears through an elevator door in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, using only his hand. A super-soldier can apply such extreme force to its hand that it can, using merely one limb, behead people - by moving their hand quickly in a horizontal slicing action - and cut through layers of metal. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Existence&quot;) In 2001, Billy Miles used this ability to behead Dr. Lev and Duffy Haskell. Soon after these killings, Miles was about to use the same ability to attack AD Skinner, on the roof of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, when Miles was pushed off the roof by Mulder. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;) Upon returning to the FBI building shortly thereafter, Miles used a straightened hand as well as his forearm to cut through an elevator door and seriously injure AD Skinner, having chased him and Krycek inside the elevator. Billy Miles' arm continued to tear through the elevator door, as the elevator lowered, but he soon lifted his arm out of the hole he had torn, releasing the elevator with a shudder. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Later that year, near the docked Valor Victory, Shannon McMahon decapitated Knowle Rohrer using only her hand, in a swiping motion. Moments later, however, one of Rohrer's hands, from his headless body, thrust clean through McMahon's torso, causing her to spasm, before the remains of both super-soldiers ended up in the sea. The Captain of the Valor Victory had also been beheaded by this time, presumably by Rohrer. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) Supernatural Strength Super-soldiers have enormous strength. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Existence&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) In 2001, Billy Miles threw Mulder bodily through a plate glass wall in the offices of the Parenti Medical Group, causing Mulder to skid across the floor, lose consciousness and need stitching for a gash on his right temple. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;) When Scully attempts to flee her apartment with Mulder while followed by super-soldier Billy Miles in TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, they find that Scully's car has been blocked in, between cars in front of and behind her vehicle but without sufficient room to pull out. This may be another example of Billy Miles' supreme strength, if he lifted or pushed the cars together. Soon after arriving in Democrat Hot Springs, Billy Miles grabbed Agent Reyes outside and flung her a distance of at least several feet, to land against the wall of a wooden barn. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Shannon McMahon used a similar force to push Carl Wormus' leg down on the accelerator of his car and to drag Wormus, Roland McFarland and Doggett each underwater. The power of McMahon's grasp on Wormus left fingerprints on his lower leg, later found by Agents Scully – who was at a loss as to how someone had held him down, as well as who that person had been – and Reyes. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;) Near the docked Valor Victory shortly thereafter, super-soldier Knowle Rohrer attacked Doggett, throwing him several feet through the air, to land against the side of a large wooden crate, before Rohrer attempted to crush the FBI agent's head between his hands, a feat that caused Doggett considerable pain and was only interrupted by the intervention of Shannon McMahon. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) In 2002, Knowle Rohrer picked Mulder up bodily and tossed him through a glass data screen in a room of the Mount Weather complex, completely shattering the screen. (TXF: &quot;The Truth&quot;) It should be noted that use of these forms of assault seem to show excessive enjoyment for causing pain, as super-soldiers shown to use these methods were also capable of instantly killing their victims, using merely one hand. Breathing Underwater Super-soldiers can breath while submerged in water, for longer periods than humans can. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) In late 2001, Shannon McMahon used this ability to drown Carl Wormus, holding his leg underwater, effectively stopping him from swimming to the surface of the Potomac, moments after causing him to crash his car through a barricade, off a bridge and into the river. McMahon also used this ability before surfacing in a filtration pond at the Greater Maryland Water Reclamation Facility, keeping her mouth submerged in the water for a short time before climbing entirely out of the pool, and again, moments later, as she dragged worker Roland McFarland with her when she re-entered the water. After having left the facility, McMahon once again used her unusual breathing capability when she dragged Doggett underwater in one of the facility's large pools. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;) Even after Doggett had lost consciousness, McMahon was still able to directly share her own air with him, effectively preventing him from drowning. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) If Scully's dreamt vision of Shannon McMahon regaining consciousness on the seabed was accurate, it would imply that McMahon once again used her underwater breathing skill on this occasion. Her fate remains unknown, though, much like the nature of the exact superhuman abilities that Rohrer used to emerge from the sea and return to the military compound that Mulder broke into in &quot;The Truth&quot;. Super Hearing Super-soldiers have an unusually sensitive perception of sound. Using this ability, in late 2001, Knowle Rohrer made his discovery that Carl Wormus and the Captain of the Valor Victory had been trying to contact the FBI; Rohrer overheard the Captain make a telephone call to someone whom the Captain believed was Carl Wormus but was actually Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike. The Captain mentioned, during the call, that he and Carl Wormus had arranged to notify the FBI of the existence of the laboratory aboard the Valor Victory. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) This power is referred to as &quot;Super Hearing&quot; in the episode's script. Supernatural endurance Although a super-soldier's body may bleed and acquire the appearance of other injuries, they can survive being shot by a gun, run over by a car or train, severely ground up in a garbage truck, drenched in searing hot water, electrocuted and hit with a hard blow to the head by another human. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Existence&quot;, &quot;Trust No 1&quot;, et al.) They can also survive explosions, even if they are at the heart of the detonation. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;) In late 2001, in fact, Shannon McMahon claimed to Agent Doggett that both she and Knowle Rohrer, if not also the many other alien super-soldiers that existed by then, could not be killed, as it was only later that the possibility of their destruction was discovered. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;, &quot;Trust No 1&quot;) Gunshots Billy Miles survived being shot twice at close range by Special Agent John Doggett on one occasion in 2001, shortly after Miles had killed Dr. Parenti and had thrown Mulder through a plate glass wall. Due to the fact that Billy Miles had clearly felt no pain even though he had been injured, Agent Doggett - who had witnessed &quot;plenty of guys, whacked out on chemicals, keep on coming&quot; - initially believed that the most likely explanation was that Miles had been &quot;whacked out on something&quot;, meaning intoxicated. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;) Shortly after he arrived in Democrat Hot Springs, Billy Miles was shot once with a rifle fired by the Game Warden but, perhaps in the knowledge that she was also a super-soldier, he reacted as if the gunshot had killed him, falling to the ground and going limp, even as the Game Warden and Agent Reyes carried him. He also seemed to have lost too much blood to still be alive and Agent Reyes told Scully that he had &quot;no vitals&quot;. To Reyes' shock, however, he later picked himself up from the ground, moments after it was revealed to the agents that the Game Warden was a super-soldier. At FBI Headquarters, Agent Doggett later threatened super-soldiers Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane with his FBI-issue gun but realized the weapon would have little or no effect and consequently began an attempt to flee from them, which developed into their chase in the building's parking garage. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Later that year, Doggett shot Knowle Rohrer fifteen times, emptying his own gun, as the alien super-soldier approached Doggett, immediately prior to Rohrer's attack on the FBI agent. (TXF: &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;) The following year, Doggett shot the Shadow Man twice, at the left side of both the alien's leg and torso, moments after the Shadow Man had shot his own subordinate to death. When cornered by the Shadow Man, Scully aimed her gun at him, but he ignored the threat and continued to approach her. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;) Upon being cornered by Knowle Rohrer in New Mexico, Doggett and Reyes each aimed their own gun at Rohrer, who dared Doggett to shoot if he thought it would make a difference, this time. Although Doggett did shoot Rohrer with one shot that hit his torso and spluttered blood on his neck, Rohrer was unaffected until, moments later, he was destroyed by nearby magnetite. (TXF: &quot;The Truth&quot;) Car &amp; Train Collisions While crossing a street in an attempt to reach Scully's car and its occupants of her and Mulder, Billy Miles was knocked down and run over by Alex Krycek in a speeding car and, although the alien Billy Miles survived, he was wounded in the collision, as demonstrated by the fact that his face was bloodied following the incident. (TXF: &quot;Essence&quot;) Similarly, early in his and Knowle Rohrer's pursuit of Agent Doggett and AD Skinner, super-soldier Gene Crane intentionally ran up to the front of a speeding black car being driven by Skinner (with Doggett in the passenger seat), jumped onto the vehicle - causing the windscreen to splinter - and quickly rolled onto the vehicle's roof, fooling Doggett into thinking that he had been tossed over the vehicle and was left behind. The alien Gene Crane then shocked the vehicle's occupants by holding onto the roof and leaning over the side of the car, smashing the passenger window before struggling to strangle Agent Doggett. The vehicle's occupants finally managed to knock the alien Gene Crane off the side of the car by Skinner driving the car extremely close to a concrete support. Crane survived this collision but his body was severely bloodied. Knowle Rohrer had meanwhile been following Doggett and Skinner in another car and, as Agent Crane began to pick his bloodied body off the ground, the alien Rohrer ran over Crane, flattening him. Knowle Rohrer lost control of his car moments later, before ultimately crashing. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Moments after having twice been shot by Doggett, the Shadow Man fell onto a set of train tracks at the station where Scully had been waiting for Mulder's return, falling in front of the train that apparently carried Mulder as the train continued on its way. Contrary to what would normally be expected, the Shadow Man was not subsequently found lying dead on the tracks. (TXF: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;) Searing Hot Water Soon after discovering that the Game Warden was a super-soldier, Agent Reyes flung a bucket of boiling water over her and into her face. The Game Warden initially reacted in agony and her face was badly blistered from the heat of the water but - shortly after Reyes demanded to know of her, &quot;Who are you?&quot; - she suddenly calmed and her voice was strong as she spoke to Reyes. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Explosions Following his and Agent Crane's pursuit of Agent Doggett and AD Skinner, Knowle Rohrer survived his car crashing and erupting into a fiery inferno. (TXF: &quot;Existence&quot;) Impact by a Human Mulder's fight with Knowle Rohrer started with Mulder striking Rohrer with a hard blow to the head, followed by Rohrer propelling Mulder through the air. (TXF: &quot;The Truth&quot;) The script of &quot;The Truth&quot; describes this hard blow as one that &quot;might kill any normal man, but it merely slows Rohrer.&quot; Electrocution Knowle Rohrer's fight with Mulder culminated in Mulder managing to throw the super-soldier from a high catwalk and Rohrer falling onto electric wires that sparked and emitted smoke as he was electrocuted. (TXF: &quot;The Truth&quot;) Known Super-Soldiers Billy Miles Knowle Rohrer Gene Crane Game Warden Shannon McMahon &quot;Shadow Man&quot; &quot;Toothpick Man&quot; Appearances TXF: &quot;DeadAlive&quot; (Season 8) &quot;Three Words&quot; &quot;Essence&quot; &quot;Existence&quot; &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot; (Season 9) &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot; &quot;Trust No 1&quot; &quot;Providence&quot; &quot;The Truth&quot; Additional References TXF: &quot;Jump the Shark&quot; (Season 9) &quot;William&quot; (implied) Background Information Introduction The introduction of the super-soldiers, in the eighth season of The X-Files, was one factor that resulted in there being more mythology episodes in that season, another factor being that the writers wanted to finally explain some of the longer-running elements of the mythology. The rise of the super-soldiers was virtually a direct reaction to the introduction of the John Doggett character (played by Robert Patrick), following the departure of Mulder actor David Duchovny. Writer John Shiban muses over the connection between the super-soldiers' introduction and that of the Doggett character: &quot;It's a new wrinkle in the mythology that still fits and works and makes sense yet gives him an opponent. You don't want David Duchovny to leave and to burden Robert Patrick's character with having to just be the new Mulder, the new battles and having to deal with the old battles and deal with what Mulder did. You can't replace him, so the trick is to add to the mythology in a way that allows it go forward yet gives your new character something new to deal with.&quot; (The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 - Super Soldiers; Special Features; &quot;Threads of the Mythology, Part 4: Super Soldiers&quot;) Another reason why the super-soldiers were added to the mythology of The X-Files was that their conspiracy was intended to bring an action/adventure feeling to the series. Frank Spotnitz remarks on the fear factor of the scenes that show one of the super-soldiers attacking. &quot;What's so terrifying about those situations is that the attacker is without a conscience. There's no appeal. There's nothing but escape or be destroyed.&quot; (The Complete X-Files: Behind the Series, the Myths and the Movies) Misleading Name The collective name of this group of Aliens is spelled &quot;Super Soldiers&quot; in script sources. In the final scene of &quot;Trust No 1&quot;, however, Scully writes and sends an e-mail to Mulder in which she spells the group &quot;super-soldiers.&quot; Frank Spotnitz explains the duplicity inherent in the name. &quot;The super-soldiers was a lie, basically. It was a way to account for these aliens who were appearing. And explain them away in a terrestrial, somewhat believable, fashion. The idea was that the Defense Department was developing genetically-modified human beings. So that was sort of the non-alien explanation. That's not the truth, though. In fact, these were aliens.&quot; Spotnitz recalls the writers' motive for introducing this lie into the series. &quot;By Season 9, Scully had seen so much that a pretty far-out idea ended up being the real world possibility for what was going on, an alternate to the idea of there really being aliens. And that idea was that the government was creating a genetically-altered army of super soldiers [...] That was the most convincing alternative we could think of to account for what Scully had seen. It was Chris Carter's idea to have that be the mislead, have that be the real world explanation for these incredible things that we were seeing. The idea of having aliens come in and replace us, I think we probably came up with together after Season 7.&quot; Explaining why the mislead was never fully revealed as being a lie, Spotnitz comments, &quot;That was the direction the show was going in Season 9, which ultimately ended up being our final season, and so that storyline never kind of flowered as fully as it would have, had there been a Season 10.&quot; (The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 - Super Soldiers; Special Features; &quot;Threads of the Mythology, Part 4: Super Soldiers&quot;) Trivia Knowle Rohrer's destruction filming.jpg The filming of the scene wherein Super Soldier Knowle Rohrer discovers that he is being affected by nearby magnetite deposits. Series finale &quot;The Truth&quot; was originally to feature Shannon McMahon but actress Lucy Lawless became pregnant shortly after filming her appearances in the two-parter &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot; and &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today II&quot;, so Knowle Rohrer appeared in the final episode instead. The book The Complete X-Files: Behind the Series, the Myths and the Movies refers to super-soldiers as &quot;Body Snatcher-like replicants&quot; and describes magnetite as &quot;Super Soldiers' Achilles' heel,&quot; referring to both the 1955 science fiction novel The Body Snatchers (as well as its subsequent film adaptations) and classical Greek mythology. The fourth of four DVD box sets in The X-Files Mythology series is titled &quot;Super Soldiers&quot;. In a documentary featurette included in the set, John Shiban states that the rise of the super-soldiers happened in the Season 8 two-part premiere &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;Without&quot; but, in truth, the super-soldiers were not directly established until sometime after those two episodes, which instead feature Alien Bounty Hunters.

Unlike Doctor Who productions, which are produced under license by the BBC (rights holders of the Doctor Who property), these Star Trek audio series are not similarly licensed by Paramount. It is worth noting, however, that the Doctor Who audios were not initially licensed by the BBC, although this was when they were produced on an amateur rather than a professional basis, as has been the case since 1999. Examples Chronicle In 2410, Starfleet Command assigns three advanced vessels to traverse the expanse to the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. The series focuses on four junior officers newly-assigned to one of the ships, the USS Witch of Endor. 18 episodes were released in 2020. Crossroads This series, a spin-off from The Section 31 Files is a crossover venture into the Star Wars universe. The series exists in two incarnations - the first, a stand-alone episode in which two characters found themselves in the Star Wars universe, while the second was an official episode of The Section 31 Files, in which the starship Nosferatu travels to the Star Wars universe via a dimensional rift. While more entries in the series are planned, no definite production plans have yet been announced. Henglaar, M.D. A spin-off from Star Trek: Hidden Frontier, Henglaar, M.D. is a combination of Star Trek and medical drama House, M.D., starring Hidden Frontier Doctor Henglaar and a group of Starfleet Medical officers aboard a hospital ship USS Cole. Star Trek: Dimensions When the USS Churchill is destroyed, her crew is framed and forced to participate in a clandestine trip to the mirror universe to clear their good name. “In space, even the bravest sometimes face their worst nightmares…nothing has prepared us for the enemy we fight now: Ourselves. In the Mirror Universe, up is down…good is evil…and we… are just trying to survive.” Star Trek: Diplomatic Relations tells stories from the perspective of the Starfleet Diplomatic Corps, the organization that moves in after a first contact and settles in for the long haul. As of July 2008, ST:DR has been in production for six months and released its ninety-minute pilot episode. Star Trek: Eras Star Trek: Eras is an audio series by TimeWell Electronic Recording Productions. The series will span through all of the established time frames of the series, from Star Trek: Enterprise through Star Trek: Nemesis, and will be told primarily through flashback from the point-of-view of Admiral Evori aboard Deep Space 5. As of March 1, 2007, TWERPs has completed their first episode and have begun working on episode two. Star Trek: Excelsior billed as &quot;the first fan production based closely on the events of a roleplaying game&quot; (though this distinction may well belong to Defiant), Excelsior's format is unremarkable: a ship and crew explore the distant reaches of the Delta Quadrant. However, the show is notable for its extremely long and intricate multi-part stories, which typically span eight to twelve months and four or five forty-five minute episodes. Star Trek: Lost Universe Created by Jeff Lincoln and produced by StarForce Media, &quot;Star Trek: Lost Universe&quot; debuted on SoundCloud in early 2015. The Dominion War is over, the Reman threat to destroy the United Federation of Planets has been foiled, and an uneasy peace between the Romulan Star Empire and the Federation is in place. The next chapter in Federation History begins. The USS Jamestown, an experimental, Nebula Class vessel finds itself trapped in an alternate reality where the Romulan Star Empire has conquered nearly the entire Alpha Quadrant. Without allies and without a place to call home, the Jamestown begins a one-ship-rebellion against the Romulan Star Empire in an attempt to restore what was once a shining light in the Alpha Quadrant. Episodes can be found on both SoundCloud and YouTube. Star Trek: Outpost Star Trek: Outpost is an audio drama series by Giant Gnome Productions. The show's opening lines set the stage: &quot;In the darkest reaches of the United Federation of Planets, an isolated station stands sentinel over a neglected frontier. Commissioned long ago with high hopes, its promise is now all but forgotten; a lonely outpost serving as the gateway to the vast expanse beyond, where discovery… and adventure… await.&quot; With its premiere in April 2009, Star Trek: Outpost focuses on the adventures of the crew of Deep Space 3 and the USS Chimera, a once proud, now transformed Oberth-class starship. Star Trek: Pioneers Star Trek: Pioneers Debuting in 2003, this series follows the crew us the starship USS Pioneer. During a routine exploration mission, the Federation discovers a gateway to the other side of the galaxy, finding a new frontier waiting to be discovered. The Pioneer leads the exploration of this new area of space, and everything it had to offer. In March 2005, it became part of the Darker Projects family, and as of June 2006, six episodes have been produced. The series is currently on hiatus. Star Trek: The Section 31 Files The Section 31 Files is an audio series by Darker Projects that explores the darker side of the Federation, set on a starship that defends the Federation against dangers from which it cannot protect itself. The series relies on voice talents from across the globe for the production. The series ran for four seasons and 32 episodes and was followed up by Star Trek: Lost Frontier. Star Trek: Shadows of Tyranny Star Trek: Shadows of Tyranny is an independent audio production from Melting Clock Productions created by Mathieu Blondin and Sebastian Prooth. Star Trek: Shadows of Tyranny will pickup from the Star Trek TOS episode Mirror, Mirror. The series is being developed and produced by Mathieu Blondin and Sebastian Prooth (Star Trek: The Continuing Mission).

First published as a series of short stories in 1942–50, and subsequently in three collections in 1951–53, for thirty years the series was a trilogy: Foundation, Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation. It won the one-time Hugo Award for &quot;Best All-Time Series&quot; in 1966.[1][2] Asimov began adding new volumes in 1981, with two sequels: Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, and two prequels: Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation. The additions made reference to events in Asimov's Robot and Empire series, indicating that they also were set in the same fictional universe. The Foundation seriesFoundation gnome.jpg First edition dust-jacket of Foundation Prelude to Foundation Forward the Foundation Foundation Foundation and Empire Second Foundation Foundation's Edge Foundation and Earth Author Isaac Asimov Country United States Language English Genre Science fiction Publisher Astounding Magazine, Gnome Press, Spectra, Doubleday Published 1942–1993 Media type Print The premise of the stories is that, in the waning days of a future Galactic Empire, the mathematician Hari Seldon spends his life developing a theory of psychohistory, a new and effective mathematical sociology. Using statistical laws of mass action, it can predict the future of large populations. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the Empire, which encompasses the entire Milky Way, and a Dark Age lasting 30,000 years before a second empire arises. Although the momentum of the Empire's fall is too great to stop, Seldon devises a plan by which &quot;the onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little&quot; to eventually limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. To implement his plan, Seldon creates the Foundations—two groups of scientists and engineers settled at opposite ends of the galaxy—to preserve the spirit of science and civilization, and thus become the cornerstones of the new galactic empire. One key feature of Seldon's theory, which has proved influential in real-world social science,[3] is the uncertainty principle of sociology: if a population gains knowledge of its predicted behavior, its self-aware collective actions become unpredictable.

According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas in Edward Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and was invented spontaneously on his way to meet with editor John W. Campbell, with whom he developed the concepts of the collapse of the Galactic Empire, the civilization-preserving Foundations, and psychohistory.[4] Asimov wrote these early stories in his West Philadelphia apartment when he worked at the Philadelphia Naval Yard.[original research?] Foundation trilogyEdit The first four stories were collected, along with a new introductory story, and published by Gnome Press in 1951 as Foundation. The later stories were published in pairs by Gnome as Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953), resulting in the &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;, as the series is still known.[5] Later sequels and prequelsEdit In 1981, Asimov was persuaded by his publishers to write a fourth book, which became Foundation's Edge (1982).[6] Four years later, Asimov followed up with yet another sequel, Foundation and Earth (1986), which was followed by the prequels Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1993), published after his death in 1992. During the two-year lapse between writing the sequels and prequels, Asimov had tied in his Foundation series with his various other series, creating a single unified universe. The basic link is mentioned in Foundation's Edge: an obscure myth about a first wave of space settlements with robots and then a second without. The idea is the one developed in Robots of Dawn, which, in addition to showing the way that the second wave of settlements was to be allowed, illustrates the benefits and shortcomings of the first wave of settlements and their so-called C/Fe (carbon/iron, signifying humans and robots together) culture. In this same book, the word psychohistory is used to describe the nascent idea of Seldon's work. Some of the drawbacks to this style of colonization, also called Spacer culture, are also exemplified by the events described all the way back in 1957's The Naked Sun. The link between the Robot and Foundation universes was tightened by letting the robot R. Daneel Olivaw - originally introduced in The Caves of Steel - live on for tens of thousands of years and play a major role behind the scenes in both the Galactic Empire in its heyday and in the rise of the two Foundations to take its place. Asimov's Foundation series novelsEdit Note: This plot outline for the seven novels follows the series' in-universe chronology, which is not the order of publication. After many years as a trilogy comprising Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation, the series was expanded by two prequels and two sequels. Prelude to Foundation (1988)Edit Main article: Prelude to Foundation Prelude to Foundation opens on the planet Trantor, the empire's capital planet, the day after Hari Seldon has given a speech at a mathematics conference. Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history). Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile. Over the course of the book, Seldon and Dors Venabili, a female companion and professor of history, are taken from location to location by Chetter Hummin who, under the guise of a reporter, introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor. Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory. Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming; he then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of later using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy. Forward the Foundation (1993)Edit Main article: Forward the Foundation Eight years after the events of Prelude, Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale. His notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor. As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age. Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation. Foundation (1951)Edit Main article: Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel) Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled Encyclopedia Galactica. The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the &quot;Encyclopedists&quot; be exiled to a remote planet, Terminus. Seldon agrees to these terms – and also secretly establishes a second Foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the &quot;opposite end&quot; of the galaxy. After fifty years on Terminus, and with Seldon now dead, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding their own, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. At the same time, a vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open. The vault reveals a pre-recorded hologram of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their entire reason for being on Terminus is a fraud, insofar as Seldon did not actually care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the Dark Ages from 30,000 years to just one millennium, based on his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme &quot;crises&quot; – known as &quot;Seldon Crises&quot; – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the &quot;opposite end&quot; of the galaxy, and then falls silent. The Mayor of Terminus City, Salvor Hardin, proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he becomes the effective ruler. Meanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, Hober Mallow, becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the office of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's control. Foundation and Empire (1952)Edit Main article: Foundation and Empire An ambitious general of the current Emperor of the Galaxy perceives the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire's still-mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general's long-term motive for the attack, and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated. Seldon's hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy would have shown itself by its successes to be a direct threat to the Emperor himself and been recalled. A century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize, too late, that the Mule is unforeseen in Seldon's plan, and that the plan cannot have predicted any certainty of defeating him. Toran and Bayta Darell, accompanied by Ebling Mis – the Foundations's greatest psychologist – and a court jester named Magnifico familiar with the Mule, set out to Trantor to find the Second Foundation, hoping to bring an end to the Mule's reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to decipher the Second Foundation's location in order to visit it and seek their help. He is successful and also deduces that the Mule's success stems from his being a mutant who is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is murdered by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location, she having realised that Magnifico is in fact the Mule and has been using his gifts to drive Mis forward in his research, so that he can learn the location himself and subjugate the Second Foundation. Dismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, the Mule leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search. Second Foundation (1953)Edit Main article: Second Foundation As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes briefly out of hiding to face the threat directly. It consists of the descendants of Seldon's psychohistorians. While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon's mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their use of telepathic abilities. The Second Foundation launches an operation to deceive and eventually mind control the Mule, whom they have return to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation. However, as a result, the first Foundation learned something of the Second Foundation beyond the simple fact that it exists, and has some understanding of its role. This means their behavior will now be chosen in light of that knowledge, and not based on uninformed natural human behavior, which means their behavior will no longer be the natural responses required by the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. This places the Plan itself at great risk. In addition, the first Foundation starts to resentfully consider the other a rival, and a small group secretly begins to develop equipment for detecting and blocking mental influence in order to detect members of the Second Foundation. After many attempts to infer the Second Foundation's whereabouts from the few clues available, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (the &quot;opposite end of the galaxy&quot; for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and destroys a group of fifty members of the Second Foundation and is left believing they have destroyed the Second Foundation. No longer concerned with the perceived threat, their behavior as a society will tend towards those anticipated by the Plan. In fact the group of fifty were volunteers on Terminus whose role was to be captured and give the impression that they composed the whole of the Second Foundation, so that the Seldon Plan would be able to continue unimpeded. The Second Foundation itself, however, is finally revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor. The clue &quot;at Star's End&quot; was not a physical clue, but was instead based on an old saying, &quot;All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end.&quot; Foundation's Edge (1982)Edit Main article: Foundation's Edge Believing the Second Foundation still exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), young politician Golan Trevize is sent into exile by the current Mayor of the Foundation, Harla Branno, to uncover the Second Foundation; Trevize is accompanied by a scholar named Janov Pelorat. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon's hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to bring the plan back on course. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called Earth may hold the secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize's belief that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that, in the event they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take military or other action. Meanwhile, Stor Gendibal, a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on Trantor who has had a very subtle alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the Trantor native. Using the few scraps of reliable information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, to such an extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both the First and Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make the best decision among the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., Empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part. After Trevize makes his decision for Gaia's path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts both Branno's and Gendibal's minds so that each believes he or she has succeeded in a significant task. (Branno believes she has successfully negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation, and Gendibal – now leader of the Second Foundation – believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal.) Trevize remains, but is uncertain as to why he is &quot;sure&quot; that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future. Foundation and Earth (1986)Edit Main article: Foundation and Earth Still uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues on with the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship's computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the coordinates. When he physically visits the locations, he rediscovers the forgotten Spacer worlds of Aurora, Solaria, and finally Melpomenia. After searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered any answers. Aurora and Melpomenia are long deserted, but Solaria contains a small population which is extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics. When the lives of the group are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them. This leaves behind a small child who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet. Eventually, Trevize discovers Earth, but it, again, contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted). However, it dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth, but on Earth's satellite – the Moon. Upon approaching the planet, they are drawn inside the Moon's core, where they meet a robot named R. Daneel Olivaw. Olivaw explains that he has been instrumental in guiding human history for thousands of years, having provided the impetus for Seldon to create psychohistory and also the creation of Gaia, but is now close to the end of his ability to maintain himself and will shortly cease to function. Despite replacing his positronic brain (which contains 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly. He explains that no further robotic brain can be devised to replace his current one, or which will let him continue assisting for the benefit of humanity. However, some additional time can be won to ensure the long-term benefit of humanity by merging R. Daneel Olivaw's mind with the organic intellect of a human – in this case, the intellect of the child that the group rescued on Solaria. Once again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child's superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy. The decision is left ambiguous (though likely a &quot;yes&quot;) as it is implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child's benefit, but that she may have sinister intentions. Development and themesEdit The early stories were inspired by Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the &quot;decline and fall of the Galactic Empire.&quot; The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in science fiction fandom, associated with the Futurians, known as Michelism. The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as Nineteen Eighty-Four or Fahrenheit 451 do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition and they act as a moral allegory of the modern world. The Foundation series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time. In this Asimov followed the model of Thucydides' work The History of the Peloponnesian War, as he once acknowledged. Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization. Hari Seldon himself hopes that his Plan will &quot;reduce 30,000 years of Dark Ages and barbarism to a single millennium,&quot; a goal of exceptional moral gravity. Yet events within it are often treated as inevitable and necessary, rather than deviations from the greater good. For example, the Foundation slides gradually into oligarchy and dictatorship prior to the appearance of the galactic conqueror, known as the Mule, who was able to succeed through the random chance of a telepathic mutation. But, for the most part, the book treats the purpose of Seldon's plan as unquestionable, and that slide as being necessary in it, rather than mulling over whether the slide is, on the whole, positive or negative. The books also wrestle with the idea of individualism. Hari Seldon's plan is often treated as an inevitable mechanism of society, a vast mindless mob mentality of quadrillions of humans across the galaxy. Many in the series struggle against it, only to fail. However, the plan itself is reliant upon the cunning of individuals such as Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow to make wise decisions that capitalize on the trends. On the other hand, the Mule, a single individual with mental powers, topples the Foundation and nearly destroys the Seldon plan with his special, unforeseen abilities. To repair the damage the Mule inflicts, the Second Foundation deploys a plan which relies upon individual reactions. Psychohistory is based on group trends and cannot predict with sufficient accuracy the effects of extraordinary, unforeseeable individuals, and as originally presented, the Second Foundation's purpose was to counter this flaw. Later novels would identify the Plan's uncertainties that remained at Seldon's death as the primary reason for the existence of the Second Foundation, which (unlike the First) had retained the capacity to research and further develop psychohistory. Asimov tried to end the series with Second Foundation. However, because of the predicted thousand years until the rise of the next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, after a 30-year hiatus, Asimov gave in and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. This novel, which takes place some 500 years after Seldon, ties up all the loose ends and ties all his Robot, Empire, and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. This concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been a Good Life), he had no idea how to continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels. Asimov's imprecise future historyEdit Asimov (right) was inspired by the Future History stories of Heinlein (left), but self-consciously wrote that his was &quot;not the beautiful job that Heinlein did, but was actually made up 'ad hoc'&quot;.[7] In the spring of 1955, Asimov published a future history of humanity in the pages of Thrilling Wonder Stories magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the Foundation universe at that point in his life. According to the publication, &quot;the scheme was not originally worked out as a consistent pattern and only includes about one-quarter of his total writings&quot;. Because of this, the dating in the foundation series is approximate and inconsistent.[7] Asimov estimates that his Foundation series takes place nearly 50,000 years into the future, with Hari Seldon born in 47,000 CE.[7] Around this time, the future emperor Cleon I is born in the imperial capital Trantor, 78 years before the Foundation Era (FE) and the events of the original Foundation trilogy. After Cleon inherits the crown, the mathematician Hari Seldon comes to Trantor from Helicon to deliver his theory of psychohistory that predicts the fall of the empire, which triggers the events of Prelude to Foundation.[8] Forward the Foundation picks up the story a few years later, with the emperor being assassinated and Seldon retiring from politics.[9] At the start of the Foundation Era, the events of the original Foundation novel (first published in Astounding Science Fiction as a series of short stories) take place, and the in-universe Foundation Era truly begins.[10] According to Asimov, he intended this to take place around the year 47000 CE, with the Empire in decay as it battles the rising Foundation, who emerges as the dominant power a few centuries later.[7] Thus begins the events of the Foundation and Empire, which include the unpredicted rise of the Mule, who defeats the Foundation thanks to his mutant abilities.[11] The events of Second Foundation chronicle the titular Second Foundation's search and defeat of the Mule, and their conflict with the remnants of the original Foundation, averting the Dark Age.[12] Asimov estimates that the Mule rises and falls somewhere around 47300 CE.[7] Foundation's Edge takes place 500 years after the establishment of the Foundation, outside of the original trilogy of novels.[13][7] Foundation and Earth follows immediately after, with humanity choosing and justifying a third path distinct from the opposing visions of the two Foundations.[14] According to Asimov, the Second Galactic Empire is established 48000 CE, 1000 years after the events of the first novel.[7] Asimov himself commented that his fiction's internal history was &quot;actually made up ad hoc. My cross-references in the novels are thrown in as they occur to me and did not come from a systemized history. ... If some reader checks my stories carefully and finds that my dating is internally inconsistent, I can only say I'm not surprised.&quot;[7] Cultural impactEdit Impact in nonfictionEdit In Learned Optimism,[15] psychologist Martin Seligman identifies the Foundation series as one of the most important influences in his professional life, because of the possibility of predictive sociology based on psychological principles. He also lays claim to the first successful prediction of a major historical (sociological) event, in the 1988 US elections, and he specifically attributes this to a psychological principle.[16] In his 1996 book To Renew America, U. S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote that he was influenced by reading the Foundation trilogy in high school.[17] Paul Krugman, winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, credits the Foundation series with turning his mind to economics, as the closest existing science to psychohistory.[18][19] The businessman and entrepreneur Elon Musk counts the series among the inspirations for his career.[20] When Musk's Tesla Roadster was launched into space on the maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018, amongst other items it carried a 5D optical data storage copy of the Foundation series.[21][22] Stating that it &quot;offers a useful summary of some of the dynamics of far-flung imperial Rome&quot;, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed the Foundation series as an example of how science fiction &quot;can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader&quot;.[23] In the nonfiction PBS series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan referred to an Encyclopedia Galactica in the episodes &quot;Encyclopaedia Galactica&quot; and &quot;Who Speaks for Earth&quot;. AwardsEdit In 1966, the Foundation trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special Hugo Award for &quot;Best All-Time Series&quot;. The runners-up for the award were the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Future History series by Robert A. Heinlein, the Lensman series by Edward E. Smith and The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.[24] The Foundation series was the only series so honored until the establishment of the &quot;Best Series&quot; category in 2017. Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor The Lord of the Rings, and he was amazed when his work won.[25] The series has won three other Hugo Awards. Foundation's Edge won Best Novel in 1983, and was a bestseller for almost a year. Retrospective Hugo Awards were given in 1996 and 2018 for, respectively, &quot;The Mule&quot; (the major part of Foundation and Empire) for Best Novel (1946) and &quot;Foundation&quot; (the first story written for the series, and second chapter of the first novel) for Best Short Story (1943). Impact in fiction and entertainmentEdit Science fiction parodies, such as Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Harry Harrison's Bill, the Galactic Hero, often display clear Foundation influences. For instance, &quot;The Guide&quot; of the former is a spoof of the Encyclopedia Galactica, and the series actually mentions the encyclopedia by name, remarking that it is rather &quot;dry&quot;, and consequently sells fewer copies than the guide; the latter also features the ultra-urbanized Imperial planet Helior, often parodying the logistics such a planet-city would require, but that Asimov's novel downplays when describing Trantor.[citation needed] The 1957 short story Marius, which set off Poul Anderson's early future history, the Psychotechnic League, clearly shows the influence of Asimov's Foundation—though moved from the far future of a collapsing Galactic Empire to a near future of a late 20th Century Earth struggling to recover from the devastation of a nuclear Third World War. In this situation, the Finnish Professor Valti starts the science of Psychodynamics, which makes it possible to mathematically predict the future, and The Psychotechnic Institute makes use of Valti's formulas to subtly &quot;guide&quot; and manipulate the emerging world government. The similarity to Seldon and the Foundation is obvious, nor did Anderson try to hide it. Frank Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to Foundation. Tim O'Reilly in his monograph on Herbert wrote that &quot;Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into Dune is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.&quot;[26] In 1995, Donald Kingsbury wrote &quot;Historical Crisis&quot;, which he later expanded into a novel, Psychohistorical Crisis. It takes place about 2,000 years after Foundation, after the founding of the Second Galactic Empire. It is set in the same fictional universe as the Foundation series, in considerable detail, but with virtually all Foundation-specific names either changed (e.g., Kalgan becomes Lakgan), or avoided (psychohistory is created by an unnamed, but often-referenced Founder). The novel explores the ideas of psychohistory in a number of new directions, inspired by more recent developments in mathematics and computer science, as well as by new ideas in science fiction itself. In 1998, the novel Spectre (part of the Shatnerverse series) by William Shatner and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens states that the Mirror Universe divergent path has been studied by the Seldon Psychohistory Institute. The oboe-like holophonor in Matt Groening's animated television series Futurama is based directly upon the &quot;Visi-Sonor&quot; which Magnifico plays in Foundation and Empire.[27] The &quot;Visi-Sonor&quot; is also mirrored in an episode of Special Unit 2, where a child's television character plays an instrument that induces mind control over children.[citation needed] During the 2006–2007 Marvel Comics Civil War crossover storyline, in Fantastic Four #542 Mister Fantastic revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the Foundation series. According to lead singer Ian Gillan, the hard rock band Deep Purple's song The Mule is based on the Foundation character: &quot;Yes, The Mule was inspired by Asimov. It's been a while but I'm sure you've made the right connection... Asimov was required reading in the 60's.&quot;[28] AdaptationsEdit RadioEdit An eight-part radio adaptation of the original trilogy, with sound design by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4[29] in 1973—one of the first BBC radio drama serials to be made in stereo. A BBC 7 rerun commenced in July 2003. Adapted by Patrick Tull (episodes 1 to 4) and Mike Stott (episodes 5 to 8), the dramatisation was directed by David Cain and starred William Eedle as Hari Seldon, with Geoffrey Beevers as Gaal Dornick, Lee Montague as Salvor Hardin, Julian Glover as Hober Mallow, Dinsdale Landen as Bel Riose, Maurice Denham as Ebling Mis and Prunella Scales as Lady Callia. FilmEdit By 1998, New Line Cinema had spent $1.5 million developing a film version of the Foundation Trilogy. The failure to develop a new franchise was partly a reason the studio signed on to produce The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.[30] On July 29, 2008, New Line Cinema co-founders Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company Unique Pictures for Warner Brothers.[31] However, Columbia Pictures (Sony) successfully bid for the screen rights on January 15, 2009, and then contracted Roland Emmerich to direct and produce. Michael Wimer was named as co-producer.[32] Two years later, the studio hired Dante Harper to adapt the books. This project failed to materialize and HBO acquired the rights when they became available in 2014.[33] TelevisionEdit Main article: Foundation (TV series) In November 2014, TheWrap reported that Jonathan Nolan was writing and producing a TV series based on the Foundation Trilogy for HBO.[33] Nolan confirmed his involvement at a Paley Center event on April 13, 2015.[34] In June 2017, Deadline reported that Skydance Media would produce a TV series.[35] In August 2018 it was announced that Apple TV+ had commissioned a 10 episode straight-to-series order.[36] However, on April 18, 2019, Josh Friedman left the project as co-writer and co-showrunner. This was apparently planned, with either Friedman or screenwriter David Goyer leaving and the other staying.[37] On June 22, 2020, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the series would be released in 2021.[38] On 13 March 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on their shows due to the COVID-19 outbreak;[39] filming resumed on October 6, 2020.[40] The series is filmed at Troy Studios, Limerick, Ireland and the budget was expected to be approximately $50 million.[41] The first two episodes premiered on September 24, 2021.[42] Metacritic gave the first season a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.[43] Books within the greater Foundation seriesEdit Merging with other seriesEdit The series is set in the same universe as Asimov's first published novel, Pebble in the Sky, although Foundation takes place about 10,000 years later. Pebble in the Sky became the basis for the Empire series. Then, at some unknown date (prior to writing Foundation's Edge) Asimov decided to merge the Foundation/Empire series with his Robot series. Thus, all three series are set in the same universe, giving them a combined length of 18 novels, and a total of about 1,500,000 words (see the List of books below). The merge also created a time-span of the series of around 20,000 years. The stand-alone story Nemesis is also in the same continuity; being referenced in Forward the Foundation, where Hari Seldon refers to a twenty-thousand-year-old story of &quot;a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis.&quot; Commentators noted that Nemesis contains barely disguised references to the Spacers and their calendar system, the Galactic Empire and even to Hari Seldon which seem to have been deliberately placed for the purpose of later integration into the Foundation universe.[44] Asimov's &quot;Author's Note&quot; in Prelude to FoundationEdit The foreword to Prelude to Foundation contains the chronological ordering of Asimov's science fiction books. Asimov stated that the books of his Robot, Empire, and Foundation series &quot;offer a kind of history of the future, which is, perhaps, not completely consistent, since I did not plan consistency to begin with.&quot; Asimov also noted that the books in his list &quot;were not written in the order in which (perhaps) they should be read&quot;.[45] In the Author's Note, Asimov noted that there is room for a book between Robots and Empire and The Currents of Space, and that he could follow Foundation and Earth with additional volumes. Forward the Foundation, Nemesis, and The Positronic Man do not appear in Asimov's list, as they were not yet published at the time, and the order of the Empire novels in Asimov's list is not entirely consistent with other lists. For example, the 1983 Ballantine Books printing of The Robots of Dawn lists the Empire novels as: The Stars, Like Dust, The Currents of Space, and Pebble in the Sky. Given that The Currents of Space includes Trantor and that The Stars, Like Dust does not, these two books possibly were accidentally reversed in Asimov's list. Asimov's standalone novels set in the Foundation universeEdit While not mentioned in the &quot;Author's Note&quot; of Prelude to Foundation, the novels The End of Eternity (1955), Nemesis (1989), and The Positronic Man (1992) are related to the greater Foundation series. The End of Eternity is vaguely referenced in Foundation's Edge, where a character mentions the Eternals, whose &quot;task it was to choose a reality that would be most suitable to Humanity&quot;. (The End of Eternity also refers to a &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; within its story.) Asimov himself did not mention The End of Eternity in the series listing from Prelude to Foundation. As for Nemesis, it was written after Prelude to Foundation, but in the author's note Asimov explicitly states that the book is not part of the Foundation or Empire series, but that some day he might tie it to the others. In Forward the Foundation, Hari Seldon refers to a 20-thousand-year-old story of &quot;a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis&quot;, a reference to Nemesis. In Nemesis, the main colony is one of the Fifty Settlements, a collection of orbital colonies that form a state. The Fifty Settlements possibly were the basis for the fifty Spacer worlds in the Robot stories. The implication at the end of Nemesis that the inhabitants of the off-Earth colonies are splitting off from Earthbound humans could also be connected to a similar implication about the Spacers in Mark W. Tiedemann's Robot books. According to Alasdair Wilkins, in a discussion posted on Gizmodo, &quot;Asimov absolutely loves weird, elliptical structures. All three of his non-robot/Foundation science fiction novels — The End of Eternity, The Gods Themselves, and Nemesis — leaned heavily on non-chronological narratives, and he does it with gusto in The Gods Themselves.&quot;[46] In The Robots of Dawn, Dr. Han Fastolfe briefly summarizes the story from The Positronic Man (1992) or &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; (1976) in a conversation with Elijah Baley. Asimov's novels set in the greater Robot/Empire/Foundation universeEdit The following novels are listed in chronological order by narrative: I, Robot (1950) - a fixup novel composed of 9 short stories about robots, set in the 21st century on Earth The Positronic Man (1992) - a standalone robot novel, co-written with Robert Silverberg, based on Asimov's 1976 novelette &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot;, set from the 22nd to 24th centuries Nemesis (1989) - a standalone novel, set in the 23rd century in a star system about 2 light years from Earth, when interstellar travel was new The Caves of Steel (1954) - first Robot Series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel, set in the 35th century on Earth[47] The Naked Sun (1957) - second Robot Series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel, set in the 35th century on the Spacer planet Solaria[47] The Robots of Dawn (1983) - third Robot Series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel, set in the 35th century on the Spacer planet Aurora[47] Robots and Empire (1985) - fourth Robot Series/R. Daneel Olivaw novel, set in the 37th century on Earth, Solaria, Aurora, and Baleyworld[47] The Stars, Like Dust (1951) - first Empire Series novel, set thousands of years in the future before the founding of a Galactic Empire The Currents of Space (1952) - second Empire Series novel, set thousands of years in the future during Trantor's unification of the galaxy into a Galactic Empire Pebble in the Sky (1950) - third Empire Series novel, primarily set thousands of years in the future on Earth, when the galaxy is unified into a Galactic Empire Prelude to Foundation (1988) - first Foundation Series novel Forward the Foundation (1993) - second Foundation Series novel Foundation (1951) - third Foundation Series novel Foundation and Empire (1952) - fourth Foundation Series novel Second Foundation (1953) - fifth Foundation Series novel Foundation's Edge (1982) - sixth Foundation Series novel Foundation and Earth (1986) - seventh Foundation Series novel The End of Eternity (1955) - a standalone novel, about Eternity, an organization &quot;outside time&quot; which aims to improve human happiness by altering history Other authors contributing to the expanded seriesEdit Asimov's novels covered only 500 of the expected 1,000 years it would take for the Foundation to become a galactic empire. The novels written after Asimov did not continue the timeline but rather sought to fill in gaps in the earlier stories. The Foundation universe was once again revisited in 1989's Foundation's Friends, a collection of short stories written by many prominent science fiction authors of that time. Orson Scott Card's &quot;The Originist&quot; clarifies the founding of the Second Foundation shortly after Seldon's death; Harry Turtledove's &quot;Trantor Falls&quot; tells of the efforts by the Second Foundation to survive during the sacking of Trantor, the imperial capital and Second Foundation's home; and George Zebrowski's &quot;Foundation's Conscience&quot; is about the efforts of a historian to document Seldon's work following the rise of the Second Galactic Empire. Also, shortly before his death in 1992, Asimov approved an outline for three novels by Roger MacBride Allen, known as the Caliban trilogy, set between Robots and Empire and the Empire series. The Caliban trilogy describes the terraforming of the Spacer world Inferno, a planet where an ecological crisis forces the Spacers to abandon many long-cherished parts of their culture. Allen's novels echo the uncertainties that Asimov's later books express about the Three Laws of Robotics, and in particular the way a thoroughly roboticized culture can degrade human initiative. After Asimov's death and at the request of Janet Asimov and the Asimov estate's representative, Ralph Vicinanza approached Gregory Benford and asked him to write another Foundation story. He eventually agreed, and with Vicinanza and after speaking &quot;to several authors about [the] project&quot;, formed a plan for a trilogy with &quot;two hard SF writers broadly influenced by Asimov and of unchallenged technical ability: Greg Bear and David Brin.&quot;[48] Foundation's Fear (1997) takes place chronologically between part one and part two of Asimov's second prequel novel, Forward the Foundation; Foundation and Chaos (1998) is set at the same time as the first chapter of Foundation, filling in background; Foundation's Triumph (1999) covers ground following the recording of the holographic messages to the Foundation, and ties together a number of loose ends. These books are now claimed by some[49][50] to collectively be a &quot;Second Foundation trilogy&quot;, although they are inserts into pre-existing prequels and some of the earlier Foundation storylines and not generally recognized as a new Trilogy. In an epilogue to Foundation's Triumph, Brin noted he could imagine himself or a different author writing another sequel to add to Foundation's Triumph, feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.[51] More recently, the Asimov estate authorized publication of another trilogy of robot mysteries by Mark W. Tiedemann. These novels, which take place several years before Asimov's Robots and Empire, are Mirage (2000), Chimera (2001), and Aurora (2002). These were followed by yet another robot mystery, Alexander C. Irvine's Have Robot, Will Travel (2004), set five years after the Tiedemann trilogy. In 2001, Donald Kingsbury published the novel Psychohistorical Crisis, set in the Foundation universe after the start of the Second Empire. Novels by various authors (Isaac Asimov's Robot City, Robots and Aliens and Robots in Time series) are loosely connected to the Robot series, but contain many inconsistencies with Asimov's books, and are not generally considered part of the Foundation series. In November 2009, the Isaac Asimov estate announced the publication of a prequel to I, Robot under the working title Robots and Chaos, the first volume in a prequel trilogy featuring Susan Calvin by fantasy author Mickey Zucker Reichert. The first book was published in November 2011 under the title I, Robot: To Protect, followed by I, Robot: To Obey in 2013 and I, Robot: To Preserve in 2016.[52] Stories set in the Foundation universe, including works by other authorsEdit The following works are listed in chronological order by narrative: C Year Title Notes 2011 I, Robot: To Protect New prequel I, Robot trilogy by Mickey Zucker Reichert 2013 I, Robot: To Obey New prequel I, Robot trilogy by Mickey Zucker Reichert 2016 I, Robot: To Preserve New prequel I, Robot trilogy by Mickey Zucker Reichert 1 1950 I, Robot The first collection of Robot short stories, all of which were included in The Complete Robot, except for the binding text, which is absent from The Complete Robot. 1964 The Rest of the Robots Includes 8 Robot short stories that were not in I, Robot, as well as the novels The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun 1982 The Complete Robot Omnibus of I, Robot and The Rest of the Robots, although not including the binding text from I,Robot or the novels The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun from The Rest of the Robots 1986 Robot Dreams Includes &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; and other short stories. 1990 Robot Visions Includes &quot;Robot Visions,&quot; &quot;Too Bad,&quot; &quot;Christmas Without Rodney,&quot; and other short stories and essays. 1995 Gold A collection of short stories and essays, including robot short stories &quot;Cal&quot; and &quot;Kid Brother&quot;. 1993 Predator First book of Isaac Asimov's Robots in Time series by author William F.

It was edited by Martin H. Greenberg, with contributing authors including Ray Bradbury, Robert Silverberg, Frederik Pohl, Poul Anderson, Harry Turtledove, and Orson Scott Card. 2001 Psychohistorical Crisis Psychohistorical Crisis is a science fiction novel by Donald Kingsbury. An expansion of his 1995 novella &quot;Historical Crisis&quot;, it is a re-imagining of the world of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, set after the establishment of the Second Empire. 18 1955 The End of Eternity Members of the time-changing organization Eternity seek to ensure that their own organization is founded as history says it was, by ensuring the conditions for that event happen as history says they happened. Asimov tied this novel into his broader Foundation Series, by suggesting in Foundation's Edge that it is set in a universe where Eternity had existed but was destroyed by Eternals, resulting in an all-human galaxy. Major characters in the Foundation seriesEdit Main article: List of Foundation series characters R. Daneel Olivaw, a humanoid robot who was created on Earth by a Spacer roboticist Hari Seldon, leader of the Psychohistorical movement which creates the Foundation and the Seldon plan NotesEdit ^ The final section of Forward the Foundation, &quot;Epilogue&quot;, appears to directly precede Hari Seldon's death. Therefore, at least this part of the book would be located after the events of Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph and the first chapter of Foundation.

IDW Publishing has provided fans with their very own collection that explores the rest of the Star Trek Universe. Let's see what are the Top Ten Star Trek Comics you should be looking out for. 10. &quot;Star Trek: Mirror Images&quot; startrekcomic10 In an alternate reality, evil Captain Kirk reigns supreme but his thirst for absolute power is unquenchable. Now, evil Kirk has set his eyes on Captain Pike and the Enterprise. Will he unseat Pike from his throne and takeover the Enterprise? 9. &quot;Star Trek: Burden of Knowledge&quot; startrekcomic9 What happens when Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and McCoy are kidnapped during their mission? Will the rest of the Enterprise crew be able to rescue them in time? What lengths will Bones go through when his medical ethics are tested? 8. &quot;Star Trek Archives Vol.2: Best of The Borg&quot; startrekcomic8 The Borg has always been the deadliest of Captain Jean Luc Picard's enemies. Even when things were at their worst, Picard never lowered his shields and surrendered his ship to the Borg. Even after being turned into one of them, Picard found out the hard way how to regain his humanity. 7. &quot;Star Trek : Spock Reflections&quot; startrekcomic7 How does someone like Spock, a Vulcan, live on Romulus for many years? What kind of person settles there and then decides to leave? Who does Spock turn into when he returns back to Earth? 6. &quot;Star Trek/Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; startrekcomic6 Somehow the timeline has suddenly changed for both heroes. The Imperial Planets of Terra have taken over and are hunting down members of the Enterprise crew and the Legion of Superheroes. When both teams finally meet, they have to set things right. 5. &quot;Star Trek: Infestation&quot; startrekcomic5 Zombies! That's right! Kirk, Spock, and McCoy have to fight zombies in space. Set phasers to kill because stunning them won't put them down! 4. &quot;Star Trek: Nero&quot; startrekcomic4 After Khan, my next favorite big bad on my list is Nero. After watching his family die right in front of him, Nero never stops hunting down the man responsible, Spock. 3. &quot;Star Trek Classics: The Gorn Crisis&quot; startrekcomic3 Captain Picard is sent in to secure an alliance with The Gorn. But, when there is a civil war brewing within the Gorn, who will Picard choose to help? When neither side trusts each other, who will be the victor in the end? 2. &quot;Star Trek: Leonard McCoy-Frontier Doctor&quot; startrekcomic2 Before there was Dr. Gregory House, you had Dr. Leonard McCoy treating patients with weird illnesses. I always wondered how an angry doctor such as McCoy ended up on the Enterprise. &quot;Dammit Jim! I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!&quot; 1. &quot;Star Trek: Khan Ruling In Hell&quot; startrekcomic1 Besides J.J. Abrams' reboot, my favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie of all-time is &quot;Wrath of Khan.&quot; I definitely want to read about Khan, who single-handedly defeated Kirk and quoted Shakespeare before dying! Say it with me now, &quot;Khaaan!&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; inspired many writers to continue the mission of the Enterprise crew. With tons of stories about Kirk, Spock, Picard, and Worf, there's definitely something for Trekkies out there.

How to run it? How does it work? Here's the complete guide about using AppImage in Linux. Abhishek Prakash Abhishek Prakash 29 Dec 2022 8 min read On this page Brief: This AppImage tutorial shows you how to use AppImage to install software and how to remove the applications it installed. There are ways to install the software in Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution. Downloading .deb or .rpm files and double click on them to install software is one of the most convenient ways to do that. Recently, you might have noticed that some applications are downloaded with an extension .appimage. And you may wonder what are these .appimage files. In this tutorial, I’ll show you what an AppImage is and how to use AppImage to install applications in Linux. In addition, I’ll also tell you a few things you should keep in mind while using AppImage. What is AppImage? AppImage is a relatively new packaging format that gives you a click-to-run way of running applications in Linux. Unlike traditional DEB/RPM packages, AppImages can be used on any distribution and this is what makes them so attractive to the Linux users. For years, we have DEB packages for Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions and RPM packages for Fedora/SUSE-based Linux distributions. While these packages provide a convenient way of installing software to their respective distribution users, it is not the most convenient for the application developer. The developers have to create multiple packages for multiple distributions. This is where AppImage comes into the picture. AppImage is a universal software package format. By packaging the software in AppImage, the developer provides just one file ‘to rule them all.’ End-user, i.e., you can use it in most (if not all) modern Linux distributions. AppImage doesn’t install the software in the traditional way A typical Linux software will create files at various places, requiring root permission to make these changes to the system. AppImage doesn’t do it. In fact, AppImage doesn’t really install the software. It is a compressed image with all the dependencies and libraries needed to run the desired software. You execute the AppImage file, you run the software. There is no extraction, no installation. You delete the AppImage file, and the software is removed (we’ll see about it later). You can compare it to .exe files in Windows that allow you to run the software without actually going through the installation procedure. Let me list some of the features or benefits of AppImage. AppImage features Distribution agnostic: Can run on various different Linux distributions No need of installing and compiling software: Just click and play No need for root permission: System files are not touched Portability: Can be run anywhere including live disks Apps are in read-only mode Software is removed just by deleting the AppImage file Applications packaged in AppImage are not sandboxed by default. How to use AppImage in Linux Using AppImage is pretty simple. It is done in these three simple steps: Download AppImage file Make it executable Run it Don’t worry, I’ll show you how to run AppImage in detail. I am using Ubuntu 22.04 in this AppImage tutorial, but you can also use the same steps on other Linux distributions. After all, the entire point of AppImage is to be independent of the distributions. Step 1: Download the .appimage package There is plenty of software that is available in AppImage format. Krita, Kdenlive, and OpenShot are just a few names. You can find an extensive list of applications available in AppImage format here. I will be using the OpenShot video editor in this tutorial. You can download it from its website. Step 2: Make it executable By default, the downloaded AppImage file won’t have execution permission. You’ll have to change the permission on the file to make it executable. You don’t need root privilege to do that. If you prefer the graphical way, just right-click on the downloaded .appimage file and select Properties. right click on appimage file and select propertiesRight-click on AppImage file and select Properties In the next screen, go to the Permissions tab and check the box that says “Allow executing file as program”. make the appimage file executableMake the AppImage file executable Alternatively, if you prefer the command line, you can simply use the below command to make an AppImage file executable: chmod u+x &lt;AppImage File&gt; Step 3: Run the AppImage file Once you have made the AppImage file executable, just double-click on it to run it. It will see the software running as you would have installed it on your system. Cool, isn’t it? If you are facing issues with AppImage in Ubuntu, this troubleshooting article may help you. How to uninstall AppImage software Since the software is never installed, there is no need to ‘uninstall’ it. For AppImages used according to Method 1, just delete the associated AppImage file and your software is removed from the system. If you integrated the AppImage through AppImage Launcher, you can right-click on the application and select Remove AppImage from the system option. remove appimage from the systemRemove AppImage from the system This will ask you for confirmation. confirm removal of appimageConfirm removal of AppImage Pressing OK will remove the AppImage and associated files from the system. Optional: Use AppImage Launcher to to enhance your experience In the previous method, in order to run an AppImage, you need to know the location of the AppImage file, and each time, you should go there and open it. This is a time-consuming process. So there is a utility called AppImage Launcher for Linux, which allows you to manage the AppImage. AppImage Launcher integrates your AppImage software with the application launcher. This means that the apps will now be available to be searched through the system application menu and you don’t need to go to the AppImage file each time. For Ubuntu, there is a stable PPA available to install the AppImage Launcher. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable sudo apt update sudo apt install appimagelauncher Once installed, you can open any AppImage file you downloaded by double-clicking. AppImage Launcher interface will be popped up and ask permission to integrate the AppImage with the system menu. appimage launcher first runAppImage Launcher first run You can change the centralized AppImage file location to your liking by pressing the customize button. Also, in the above screenshots, you can toggle off the checkbox, which will automatically move the new AppImage to the specified location. Pressing the OK button will ask permission to either run once or integrate and run. confirm integration of appimage in appimage launcherConfirm integration of AppImage in AppImage launcher If you press run once, the application will run, but will not be integrated. So, in order to get the benefit, press “integrate and run”. This will move the AppImage to the specified location and the app will now be accessible from the system menu and can also be pinned to your dash or dock. openshot application in ubuntu activities overviewOpenShot application in Ubuntu Activities Overview One convenience here is, you don’t even need to make the file executable. Everything will be done by AppImage Launcher. Things to remember while using AppImage in Linux There are a few additional things about AppImage that you should know. 1. Poorly packaged AppImage won’t run even with execution permission The concept of AppImage is to have all the dependencies inside the package itself. But what if the developer thought that he had packaged all the dependencies but that didn’t really happen? In such cases, you’ll see that even giving execute permission to the AppImage does nothing. You click on the AppImage and nothing happens. You can check if there is such an error by opening a terminal and running the AppImage like you run a shell script. Here’s an example: abhishek@itsfoss:~/Downloads$ ./compress-pdf-v0.1-x86_64\ \(1\).AppImage /tmp/.mount_compreWhr2rq/check: line 3: xterm: command not found Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;compress-pdf_Qt.py&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt; from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5' As you can see, the AppImage I was trying to run had some packaging issues. If you encounter something like this, you should contact the developer and inform her/him about the issue. 2. Desktop integration without AppImage Launcher When you run an AppImage file, some software may prompt you to ‘install a desktop file’. If you select yes, your AppImage will be integrated with your Linux system like a regularly installed application. create a desktop file for the application dialog boxCreate a desktop file for the application dialog box Your software will be searchable through GNOME or any application launcher. You can find it in the menu and lock it to the dash or Launcher. You can, however, make (most) AppImage applications integrate with the desktop by using AppImage Launcher discussed above. 3. Desktop integration without AppImage Launcher may require manual cleanup post removal If you choose desktop integration, you’ll have a few files created in your system. The file size will only be in a few Kb, though. Unlike the AppImage Launcher, when you delete the AppImage file, these desktop files remain in your system. You may leave it as it is or delete it manually. 4. Choose where you put the AppImage files The downloaded AppImage files should arrive in the Download folder. But this might not be the best place to keep it as it gets cluttered over time. It is better to keep them in a separate directory for easier management. Also, remember that if you chose desktop integration and then moved the AppImage file to another location, you’ll have to remove the desktop files first. Else the desktop integration might not work. 5. Update is not always an option Maybe some software will check for updates automatically and notify you about the availability of a newer version. But that’s not going to happen most of the time. openshot application prompting an update inside the applicationOpenShot application prompting an update inside the application There is a command line option to check and update the software, but that also depends on whether the developer provided this option. In short, automatic updates are not always possible. It depends on whether the developer has added that feature or not. Most of the time, you’ll have to find on your own if a newer version of the software is available. Conclusion There are other “universal Linux apps” such as Snap by Ubuntu and Flatpak by Fedora. Since this article was about using AppImage, I didn’t go into the Snap vs Flatpak vs AppImage debate. To me, AppImage is a nice way to use software across Linux distributions. I do hope that the update process improves here to make it much more useful for end users. What do you think of AppImage? Do you prefer to use AppImage in Linux over other formats?

So much so that pretty much every Linux distribution has support for them — except Linux Mint. The reason for this is that the developers behind the Linux Mint operating system feel that Snap technology doesn’t meet their needs fully. They’ve instead decided to disable Snaps by default. In fact, even though the last few versions of their operating system are based on Ubuntu 16.04 (an OS with snaps turned on already), it is disabled. Instead, Linux Mint has fully embraced Flatpak. It’s a solid alternative to Snaps, as Flatpak also has a lot of packages available for it. That said, the overall excitement seems to be behind Snaps, with companies as large as Microsoft advertising it officially. If you’re a Mint user who’d like to keep Flatpak but use Snaps too, there is an easy way to enable Snap package support. Snapd On Linux Mint To enable Snap package support on Linux Mint, you need to install the package because the Linux Mint team chooses to remove the Snap tools and processes by default. To install the software on Linux Mint, you’ll need to open up a terminal window. Once the terminal window is open, enter: sudo -s to gain root access. Using a root shell rather than individual sudo commands can come in handy if you’re going to interact with the system a lot. After gaining a root shell, use the update command to get your system running the latest software. This is important so that the Snapd tool runs correctly. Keep in mind that if you’re not comfortable using the commands to update Linux Mint, the Mint Updater tool is also available for use and will work just as well. First, use the apt update command to refresh the Linux Mint software sources. This will also determine if there are any updates available for the system. apt update Next, use the apt upgrade command to install the new updates that the system says are available. Be sure to also add -y to the end, so that the command will automatically say “yes”. This saves time from having to press “y” on the keyboard later on. apt upgrade -y With the software updates installed, we can install the software required to run Snap packages on Linux. apt install snapd The system should automatically enable all of the systemd services on Linux Mint that Snapd needs to function properly. If for some reason there is an error in enabling these, try: apt purge snapd Running the purge command is a great way to fix any issues with the Snap runtime, as purge will delete and completely remove all references to snaps on the system. Hence the name “purge”. When the purge command finishes, it’s safe to re-install snapd on the system. Since you purged everything, Linux Mint will be forced to re-download and re-setup everything and should fix any issues that pop up. apt install snapd Snaps On Linux Mint – Terminal Now that Linux Mint has snap support, there’s something you should know: it won’t be as good as it is on Ubuntu. The main reason for this is that Linux Mint 18.3 (and other 18.x versions) run on top of an Ubuntu 16.04 base. Ubuntu LTS is a solid base for an operating system, but it has its drawbacks, mainly the fact that versions of software may be a little outdated. On Ubuntu 17.04, and 17.10 users can easily browse and install snaps in Gnome Software, thanks to the Software snaps plugin. Unfortunately, that plugin requires version 3.26 of Gnome, and Mint only has 3.22. This means that all snaps you install under Mint must be done with the terminal. To install a snap package under Linux Mint, open up a terminal and do: snap find &quot;program name&quot; This will output a list of packages that are installable, related to your snap search. To install a snap, look at the list and copy the exact name of the package. Then, use this command to install it on the system. sudo snap install programname Often times Snaps require updating. To update your list of snap packages to the latest version, you’ll need to use the “refresh” command. Each time the refresh command is used, Snapd will go out and get the newest possible version of the app from the store and replace it with the old one. sudo snap refresh Snaps are easy to uninstall from Linux Mint. Users can do it at any time by using the remove command. sudo snap remove programname Lastly, if you’d like to list all available snaps in the snap store, try using search command without anything after it. snap search Want to save the entire list of installable snaps to a file for later reading? Try outputting it. snap search &gt;&gt; ~/snap-list.txt Access the saved file at any time by opening snap-list.txt in /home/ on your Linux PC.

Complex.com is a part of Complex Networks logo The 25 Best DC Comics Of All Time ByJason Serafino Jason Serafino is a contributing writer at Complex who covers movies, TV, and comic books. Jan 18, 2018 Previous SlideNext Slide lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941929 Originally conceived as National Allied Publications back in 1934, DC Comics (an abbreviation of Detective Comics) has stuck around long enough to become one of the two biggest and hottest comic book companies in America. It’s home to some of the most iconic characters in all of pop culture, such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. These characters have slowly transcended the superhero genre to the point that it’s rare that you go a day without seeing a person walking down the street in either a Superman or Batman shirt. DC is much more than a few nice-looking symbols on T-shirts, though. Along the way, the company has produced some of the best comic books ever, with many of them receiving high praise from TIME Magazine and The New York Times. Unfortunately, the company has lost touch with the general public in recent times. Reading DC comics has become more and more like a chore every week, and while hardcore fans still pick these books up, it’s purely out of habit— instead, we turn to movie adaptations like the Green Lantern and Christopher Nolan’s Batman. In celebration of the print inspiration for our favorite action-packed blockbusters, we’re taking a look back at where the company came from, and the characters that are getting rebooted, with The Top 25 DC Comics Of All Time! 25. THE SINESTRO CORPS WAR (2007-2008) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941922 best dc comics green lantern sinestro Image via WikiCommons Most of the time, comic book crossovers are simply a way for publishers to pump some extra money out of fans. They’re usually bloated, highly priced, affairs that depend on cheap publicity stunts to gain attention, as opposed to solid storytelling. 2007’s Sinestro Corps War bucked that trend by featuring killer art and a deep story that actually had a reason for existing. When Sinestro broke apart from the Green Lantern Corps, he was obsessed with brining his unyielding brand of justice to the universe by any means necessary. And after years of failing on his own, the clever killer from Korugar created his own Yellow Lanterns Corps in order to combat the Green Lanterns. Gone was the moustache-twirling Sinestro of the Silver Age, as this new version of the character was modeled after Adolf Hitler and other historical dictators in order to provide some much needed depth to the story. Writer Geoff Johns brought cosmic action back to comics with a plot that was dense enough for hardcore fans, yet relatable to everyone. Once again, DC proved that you don’t need pervasive violence, bloodshed, or rape to bring in readers, only good stories and fantastic art. 24. THE COYOTE GOSPEL (1988) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941918 best dc comics coyote gospel Image via WikiCommons Grant Morrison’s most startling issue on Animal Man came just five issues into the series in a story called The Coyote Gospel. In it, Morrison introduced the world to Crafty, a former cartoon character that gets sent to the world of comic books. It turns out that Crafty made a deal with his cartoon world’s “creator” to end the cycle of violence in his world, but the creator forced him to suffer in the world of comics in exchange for the peace of his world. Morrison made Crafty an allegory for Christ as he was made to suffer in order to bring peace to his people. While most comic fans may not think of religious metaphors when they pick up these books, Morrison put it in anyway and, in turn, crafted one of the most intelligent single issues of a comic book ever. 23. GREEN ARROW: THE LONGBOW HUNTERS (1987) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941914 best dc comics green arrow longbow Image via WikiCommons Feeling that the Green Arrow had grown stale over the years, DC hired writer/artist Mike Grell to reimagine the character in a grittier light, similar to Batman in Batman: Year One. Grell stripped the character of his Silver Age trick arrows (such as the boxing glove arrow and the soda can arrow) and gave Oliver Queen a more realistic costume to fight crime in. The idea was to appeal to fans of the more street-level vigilante books that had been a rousing success in the marketplace. Grell’s first story on the character, titled The Longbow Hunters, places the Arrow in Seattle, as opposed to the fictitious Star City, as he fights against serial killers, the CIA, and a mysterious assassin named Shado. The Longbow Hunters is an extremely graphic and violent story that not only shows the Green Arrow actually kill his targets, but also features the brutal torture of his girlfriend, The Black Canary. Despite the overwhelming violence, The Longbow Hunters is one of the best reboots ever for a superhero and stands out as being more than a simple “gritty” crime story. 22. JLA: EARTH 2 (2000) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941908 best dc comics jla earth 2 Image via WikiCommons Featuring high-octane superhero action at its finest, Earth 2 pits the Justice League against its twisted counterpart from a parallel Earth, The Crime Syndicate. This team is comprised of evil versions of Justice League stalwarts, such as Batman, Superman, Flash, Wonder Woman, and plenty of others. In addition to some widescreen action, this book also breaks down the logistics of alternate realities. Writer Grant Morrison explores the very nature of these alternate Earths and explains that good can never truly win on an evil alternate Earth, yet, on the other hand, evil can never win on the Justice League’s Earth. It’s a much headier read than most people might expect, but Earth 2 is a flawless example of a modern superhero story that forces you to think, while satisfying your urges to watch the bad guys get thoroughly pounded. 21. IDENTITY CRISIS (2004) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941899 best dc comics identity crisis Image via WikiCommons Incredibly brutal, yet surprisingly moving, Identity Crisis was a seven-part mystery that was written by famed author Brad Meltzer and drawn by Rags Morales in 2004. The story began with the death of Elongated Man's wife, Sue Dibny. This sent shockwaves throughout the superhero community as other characters soon began to get murdered as well, such as longtime Flash villain, Captain Boomerang, and Jack Drake, father of Time Drake, a.k.a. Robin. Meltzer ties this all together in a gripping story that goes way back to the early career of the Justice League as Batman discovers a long history of deception and brutality that changes the team's dynamic forever. Along the way, there is copious amounts of violence, mind wiping, and, of course, a brutal rape scene, which seems to be obligatory in almost every modern comic nowadays. 20. JLA: TOWER OF BABEL (2000) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941895 best dc comics jla tower babel Image via WikiCommons Need any more proof that Batman is an unapologetic sociopath? Then look no further than Tower of Babel, a story that reveals that Batman has a collection of files on his computer that describe exactly how to defeat every member of the Justice League. Unfortunately, these files get compromised by the eco-terrorist Ra’s Al Ghul, and he soon begins taking down the Earth’s most powerful heroes one-by-one, thanks to Batman's paranoia. Written by Mark Waid, this story delves deep into the scarred psyche of the Caped Crusader, but it also shows how prepared Batman is for any eventuality, even if it means betraying his team’s trust in the process. Make no mistake about it, the title says it’s a Justice League story, but Tower of Babel is one of the most comprehensive studies of Batman’s personality to ever be released. 19. SUPERMAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1998) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941891 best dc comics superman for all seasons Image via WikiCommons There are currently about a dozen or so retellings of Superman’s origins. Comic books, TV shows, movies, and novels have all tried their hand at reimagining the early days of the Man of Steel, but only one book combines the best of all of them into one concise story: Superman For All Seasons. It’s nostalgic, iconic, and infinitely relatable, as writer Jeph Loeb cherry picked the best of the best from past comics and movies to flawlessly illustrate how Clark Kent became Superman. Narrated by different members of Superman’s supporting cast (Pa Kent, Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, and Lana Lang) For All Seasons attempts to humanize the Man of Steel by presenting him as a simple farmer’s son from Kansas, as opposed to the unstoppable demigod that he had become. And it also doesn't hurt that Tim Sale brings a Norman Rockwell approach to the sweeping cornfields of Kansas. 18. JSA: THE GOLDEN AGE (1993-1994) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941884 best dc comics the golden age Image via WikiCommons Using a similar approach to Watchmen, James Robinson’s The Golden Age takes a nostalgic look back at the heroes from the '40s and '50s and gives a somber portrayal of their final days. Drugs, bitter divorces, and nervous breakdowns all play a part in the retirement of some of the Justice Society’s most unflappable heroes, and it’s shocking to see these once upstanding citizens succumb to the same temptations as the rest of us. Characters such as the Hourman, Johnny Quick, Liberty Belle, and Starman are all portrayed as woefully human and tragic in this story, but no hero has it worse than the original Green Lantern, who is blacklisted during Joe McCarthy’s Senate hearings. The team eventually has to rally together to take down the threat of the Ultra-Humanite, who is masquerading in the body of former hero, Tex Thompson, a.k.a. The Americommando. It may sound a little over-the-top, but The Golden Age is a unique blend of politics and superheroes that asks the question: What do these heroes do when their careers are over? 17. SUPERMAN: RED SON (2003) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941811 best dc comics superman red son Image via WikiCommons What if baby Kal-El’s rocket missed the Kansas cornfield it was supposed to land in and, instead, crashed in the Soviet Union? This is what Mark Millar asks readers in his Elseworld title, Superman: Red Son. With Superman seated next to Stalin in his inner circle, it is up to Lex Luthor, an American genius, to come up with a way to destroy Stalin’s new “Man of Steel.” It may be a “What If?” style of story, but Millar’s slanted take on the Superman mythology is so much fun that it supersedes most of the in-continuity Superman tales of the last decade. Red Son also features twisted versions of other DC heroes like Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Batman, who sports a stylish ushanka in the comic. Millar presents time and space as very fluid and argues that any slight change in trajectory can forever alter reality. But besides all that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, it’s just great to see Superman call everyone “comrade.” 16. BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN (1996-1997) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941667 best dc comics batman the long halloween Image via WikiCommons Taking place after the events of Batman: Year One, The Long Halloween is a detailed murder mystery written by Jeph Loeb with art by Tim Sale. Together they wound up creating a complex story rich in great character development and dynamic action perfectly crafted by Sale’s atmospheric sensibilities. The plot deals with a serial killer that would commit a murder on every holiday. Simply dubbed “Holiday,” this killer is scantly seen, yet has an enormous impact on the plot as the bodies begin to pile up and the stakes begin to rise. Littered with super villains and mobsters, Loeb takes readers into the mind of the Dark Knight and shows his thoughts on the increasingly psychotic maniacs populating Gotham City. Blending big screen scope with some intimate character relationships, The Long Halloween has the perfect ratio of plot to character to action. Any Batman fan would willingly give up their right arm to read this book, and even the most jaded of comic book fans would be hard pressed to find too many things wrong with The Long Halloween. 15. Swamp Thing: The Anatomy Lesson (1984) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941796 best dc comics swamp thing Image via WikiCommons After the Wes Craven movie was released and the Swamp Thing comics failed to catch on, DC decided to place a young Alan Moore on the fledgling title, not expecting the book to even last another year. What followed was a groundbreaking run on the book that not only changed the character, but comics themselves. Alan Moore stripped fans of every preconceived notion that they had for the title, and drastically changed the mythology of Swamp Thing. No longer was he a bland scientist turned monster thanks to a horrific accident; instead, Moore turned Swamp Thing into the physical embodiment of nature and opened the door for more socially conscious stories. And this second installment of Moore's run, appearing in The Saga of Swamp Thing #21, is still one of the first mainstream comics not to be afraid to add beauty and intelligence to the medium. 14. FOR THE MAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING (1985) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941776 best dc comics superman man has everything Image via WikiCommons As they enter to Fortress of Solitude to give Superman his birthday presents, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Robin find the Man of Steel in a vegetative state with a large alien plant attached to his chest. As they try to remove it, the heroes are surprised by the alien warlord, Mongul, who reveals his plans to kill Superman once and for all. He explains that the plant is called the Black Mercy, a piece of alien vegetation that attaches itself to a victim and creates a dreamlike fantasy world in the person’s head; however, as it creates this psychic Utopia, it also slowly kills its victim. Written by Alan Moore with art by Dave Gibbons, For The Man Who Has Everything is a brutal, yet poignant, tale that sets out to humanize Superman. Superman is usually presented as unflappable, but this story perfectly illustrates the desire that he has to meet his long dead parents and live a normal life. Never before had any writer attempted to give Superman hopes or dreams. It’s that type of emotional baggage that Moore brings to these characters that makes his writing so much more meaningful than the other comic book talent in the industry. 13. JACK KIRBY’S NEW GODS (1971) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941772 best dc comics new gods Image via WikiCommons After Stan Lee took credit for all of his ideas and robbed him of the royalties, Jack Kirby jumped ship to DC Comics and created The New Gods; a sprawling space-opera that took abandoned ideas from his Marvel days and adjusted them for a new mythology. Introducing the world to characters like Darkseid, Highfather, and Orion, The New Gods was a beautifully dynamic book with a ton of action and a complicated character list with more nuances than the Lord of the Rings. The New Gods was sci-fi storytelling at its best, but Kirby always took great care in making the stories very universal in tone. There are elements from the Bible and Norse mythology present in the series, and some aspects of the story are as deep as any fantasy tale on record. Kirby’s work on New Gods was spread across multiple books, but DC has collected everything into easy to find collections recently. That’s a good thing because New Gods is a great read for anyone who doubts that comic books have some of the deepest mythology in all of America literature. 12. ARKHAM ASYLUM: A SERIOUS HOUSE ON SERIOUS EARTH (1989) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941722 best dc comics arkham asylum Image via WikiCommons In 1989, the Caped Crusader became a household name yet again with the release of Tim Burton's big budget blockbuster Batman. Not wanting to sit idly by and present stories that readers have already seen, DC rode Batman’s wave of momentum and released the groundbreaking long form graphic novel, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth. Written by Grant Morrison and beautifully illustrated by Dave McKean, Arkham Asylum became one of the most successful titles ever at the company and further bridged the gap between comic books and literature. There is never a moment in this book where you feel the creators phoning it in; every panel is rich in detail and story. Following Batman’s attempt to quell an uprising at Arkham Asylum, he is forced into a game of hide-and-seek by the Joker. Along the way, Batman finds himself exploring the asylum as he delves deeper into the psychotic minds of his adversaries. Morrison also concurrently tells the tale of the asylum’s twisted founder, Amadeus Arkham, which is a Psycho-inspired bit of horror that raises this book above just being a simple Batman story. It’s sick, twisted, and completely engrossing and beautiful. Arkham Asylum is like taking the express train through the most twisted aspects of Batman’s rogue’s gallery and it’s nearly impossible to ever look at these characters the same way again. 11. SNOWBIRDS DON’T FLY (1971) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941671 best dc comics snowbirds dont die Image via WikiCommons During the '70s, writer Denny O’Neil and artist Neal Adams attempted to add social commentary and political thought into the slumping title Green Lantern. Teaming the right-wing Emerald Warrior up with the liberally minded Green Arrow, O’Neil and Adams had the duo fight more than just costumed psychopaths; they fought social injustice and worldwide cruelty. Their most famous story was in Green Lantern/Green Arrow #85-86, when it was discovered that the Green Arrow’s former ward, Speedy, had become a drug addict. Arrow and Lantern quickly headed off to take down the dealers who provided Speedy with the heroine, but they soon found out that a corrupt CEO was behind the whole drug trade. The story treats the drugs believably, rather than as a plot point, and portrays the addicts as victims as opposed to criminals. Not only did this story shatter people’s expectations of a superhero tale, but it was actually commended by former New York Mayor, John V Lindsay, for being socially relevant for the youth of America. 10. THE MAN OF STEEL (1986) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941655 best dc comics superman man of steel Image via WikiCommons After Crisis on Infinite Earths hit the DC Universe in the ‘80s, the company decided to reboot all of its characters in the wake of the event. This was all part of a plan to modernize these decades’ old characters for a more sophisticated and cynical audience. Alongside Batman: Year One and Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals, DC launched Man of Steel, a reimagining of the Superman mythos without all of the Silver Age dead weight. Written and drawn by Uncanny X-Men veteran John Byrne, The Man of Steel took a more streamlined approach to the character, such as limiting Superman’s power-levels to be more believable, getting rid of the Superboy concept, turning Lex Luthor into a corrupt businessman, and making Clark Kent less “mild-mannered” and more of a full-fledged character. This “new look” Superman still retained what made the character great, but made it easier for casual fans to stomach some of his more outlandish aspects. It was extremely polarizing at the time, but Man of Steel still happens to be one of the most concise and enjoyable Superman reads ever. 9. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MAN OF TOMORROW? (1986) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941605 best dc comics superman whatever happened to Image via WikiCommons Before Crisis on Infinite Earths rebooted the Man of Steel, writer Alan Moore and longtime Superman artist Curt Swan decided to give the Silver Age version of the character a proper sendoff. Written as an homage to the wonky tales of the Mort Weisenger-era, this story pulled no punches and appealed to the more nostalgic sensibilities of comic book fans. This title doesn’t follow a strict continuity, nor has it ever been referenced again, but as far as Moore was concerned, this was the last Superman story ever. Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? saw the death of Krypto, Lex Luthor, Lana Lang, Jimmy Olsen, and others. It’s a grandiose curtain call for Superman that was both emotional and adrenaline pounding. Moore shows yet again just why he’s not simply the most important DC writer in history, but perhaps the most important comic book writer of all time. 8. THE KILLING JOKE (1988) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941576 best dc comics batman killing joke Image via WikiCommons What can be said about The Killing Joke that hasn’t already been said over and over? It’s a sadistically brilliant comic with some sharp dialogue and truly uncomfortable moments that would have even the most staunch gore-lover left squirming in their seat. Writer Alan Moore looks at the relationship between the Joker and Batman as more than just a man dressed as a bat throwing punches at a demented clown. Moore dissects every layer of these two characters and perfectly picks apart their difference as well as their disturbing similarities. Never before had the psyche of the Joker been given as much weight and credence as in this story, but Moore doesn’t just focus on the emotions of the grim harlequin the entire time; instead, he lets the vile actions of the Joker reveal his character. From shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon, to taking nude photos of her writhing in pain, and finally kidnapping her father and forcing him to view these perverse pictures, the Joker has never been shown as maniacal as he is in this book. But it’s not all horror and gore, Moore fills this book with beautiful prose and personality insights, aided by some nightmarish art by Brian Bolland. The Killing Joke perfectly blends comic book action and over-the-top violence, but grounds everything in an engrossing plot all at the same time. 7. TEEN TITANS: THE JUDAS CONTRACT (1984) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941569 best dc comics teen titans judas Image via WikiCommons Not many people may be aware of this, but at one point The New Teen Titans was one of the most successful books at DC, and the most memorable story in the entire series was The Judas Contract. Written by Marv Wolfman, the story was filled with everything a comic book fan could ever hope for: action, intrigue, betrayal, and, of course, statutory rape. With Deathstroke, a.k.a. the Terminator, picking off the Titans one-by-one, Nightwing knew that there was more behind the attacks than meets the eye. When Deathstroke’s ex-wife visits Dick Grayson and confirms these suspicions, he is shocked to learn that a fellow Titan named Terra had helped Deathstroke unleash his attack. It is also revealed that the 16-year-old Terra was getting down and dirty with the middle-aged, and completely loony, Deathstroke. This was a deeply personal story that changed these naive characters forever and showed them the ugly side of crime-fighting. These types of events simply didn’t happen in comics at the time, but Wolfman shrugged at the norm and brought sleazy storytelling to the mainstream. 6. THE NEW FRONTIER (2003-2004) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941557 best dc comics new frontier Image via WikiCommons Darwyn Cooke’s magnum opus over at DC, titled The New Frontier, was an ode to the comics of the '30s and '40s, and also detailed the birth of the Silver Age of comics in the '60s. Revolving around a group of heroes that would eventually comprise the Justice League, Cooke pitted the DC icons against a living island that sought to destroy the Earth. The island was really just a plot device; the story was actually about how heroes like the Green Lantern, Flash, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman joined forces and how they overcame their personality clashes to put peace and justice ahead of personal beef. New Frontier relies heavily on nostalgia, but Cooke also makes it easy for rookie comic book readers to pick up and enjoy. Along the way, there are super powered brawls galore and a whole lot of brightly colored action, but New Frontier never lets the eye-candy undermine the intricate plot or fleshed out characterizations of the DC Universe. New Frontier is a lot more fun than your average comic, but it also provides a level of sophistication in both the writing and art that few books can honestly live up to. It’s unfortunate that most writers and artists believe that grim and gritty stories are the way to go, because what Cooke did with the light tone of New Frontier is head and shoulders above almost anything that the industry has to offer. 5. KINGDOM COME (1996) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941541 best dc comics kingdom come Image via WikiCommons In the near future, the DC Universe is a much scarier place. The line between hero and villain has become increasingly blurred as new generations of vigilantes are using extreme means to fight crime, and the human population is stuck in the middle of a bloody war. Humanity’s last hope is for Superman, now self-exiled to the Fortress of Solitude, to come out of retirement and teach these young heroes what it means to be an icon. Featuring an incredibly bleak plot by Mark Waid, Kingdom Come’s most prominent feature is the beautifully painted artwork by Alex Ross. He crafts the heroes of the DC Universe as infinitely iconic and powerful, while still retaining his storytelling abilities. His art isn’t just flashy; it also perfectly complements Waid’s plot. Kingdom Come can be seen simply as a big budget action book, but it’s also a critique on the comic book industry in general, which was focusing on violent vigilantes at the time. Waid counteracted this trend by creating an epic where Superman schools the young generation and shows the world what a hero really should be. 4. CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS (1985-1986) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941480 best dc comics crisis infinite earth Image via WikiCommons Much like DC is doing this September with its companywide relaunch, Crisis on Infinite Earths was an attempt to streamline continuity and make books easier to pick up for novice comic book fans. The story focused on a being named the Anti-Monitor who wanted to destroy all of the multiple realities of the DC Universe. The 12-issue mega event saw the death of Supergirl, the Flash, the Superman of Earth-One, and countless others, but, of course, the heroes won in the end. However, DC’s continuity was never the same. All of the characters received updates and reboots, and most of the mythology was drastically overhauled. This book led to new origins such as Man of Steel, Batman: Year One, and others. While the story, written by Marv Wolfman and meticulously drawn by George Perez, was monumental for longtime fans of comics, new fans shouldn’t rush to pick it up. It’s an incredibly dense and somewhat confusing read that can even leave longtime comic book fans scratching their heads. But if you’re feeling up to the challenge, then pick it up and immerse yourself in the infinitely detailed mythology of the DC Universe. 3. BATMAN: YEAR ONE (1987) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941388 best dc comics batman year one Image via WikiCommons In 1987, DC entrusted Frank Miller to retell the origin of the Caped Crusader in a stripped-down fashion, complete with corrupt cops and a veritable supporting cast of pimps and hookers. The result was Batman: Year One, written by Miller and illustrated to noir perfection by Dave Mazzucchelli. The story depicts the first year in Gotham for Commissioner Gordon and the return of Bruce Wayne after years of exile. Miller paints Gordon as an honest cop who sees his personal life spiral out of control after being introduced to the seedy underbelly of Gotham; meanwhile, Wayne returns from years of training overseas in order to combat the corruption and violence that has overtaken his city. Together they form one of the strongest bonds in comic book history by complimenting each other’s strengths and ignoring each other's weaknesses. Miller went to great lengths to portray Batman’s world in an incredibly realistic way by taking out all of the character’s sci-fi gadgets and over-the-top villains. Instead, he left readers with an obsessed man in Spandex systematically taking down the mob, but he did it in a thrilling way that let readers in on the psychology behind the mask. And when you throw in Mazzucchelli’s near-perfect art, Year One remains not only one of the best Batman stories of all time, but one of the best comics as well. 2. ALL STAR SUPERMAN (2005-2008) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941382 best dc comics all star superman Image via WikiCommons We have to admit it: Not many great superhero comics have come out in the last decade. Marvel has had some middling success with the Ultimate Universe and Civil War, and DC created a minor stir with Infinite Crisis and 52, but nothing has really compared to the creative smorgasbord that was the ‘80s. However, in 2005, Grant Morrison yet again revitalized the comic book industry with his love letter to the Silver Age, All Star Superman. All Star revolves around Superman dealing with his own mortality and how he slowly prepares the people in his life, along with the rest of his world, for his death. Along the way, Supes fights against Bizarro, creates a micro-Earth, cures countless diseases, reignites the Sun, and gets busy with Lois Lane, all without scuffing up his costume. Focusing on the timeless elements that made the Man of Steel popular in the first place, All Star doesn’t just reboot the character or pit Superman against some mindless alien; instead, the book transcends superhero comics and delivers whimsical sci-fi/fantasy along with ultra-nuanced art by Frank Quitely. There is also an incredible amount of heart in this book that would bring some mist to even the most jaded eye. This is a book that somehow presents a completely fresh take on a 60-plus-year-old character and reminds people how good comics should be. 1. THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (1986) lead carousel placeholder complex logo 2941367 best dc comics batman dark knight Image via WikiCommons There isn’t a comic book fan alive that hasn’t at least heard of The Dark Knight Returns. Frank Miller’s dystopian view of the future of the DC Universe revolutionized the industry and, up until now, there still hasn’t been a mainstream superhero story that has surpassed it. Published in 1986, Miller loads this book with political commentary and social criticisms, all while depicting Batman as an aging vigilante with a demeanor that makes Dirty Harry look like Pat Boone. After Bruce Wayne returns to being Batman at the beginning of the story, he is soon confronted by classic villains such as Two-Face and the Joker, as well as new threats, like a murderous Mutant gang and the Man of Steel himself. Miller’s intentionally crude and rough illustrations complement the whole tone of the story perfectly as his Batman is built more like a refrigerator than a sleek gymnast. Along with other Caped Crusader stories by Denny O’Neil and Steve Englehart, The Dark Knight Returns is one of the books that gave Batman his balls back by making him a brash, foul-mouthed brute who doesn’t take it easy on criminals. He even puts the boots to Superman when he has to. Not only did Miller change the character of Batman forever, but he also irreversibly changed the medium as a whole. In a world where superheroes are on the side of every lunchbox and companies are more concerned with maintaining the status-quo than producing actual art, The Dark Knight Returns still stands as an absolute gem in the industry and solidified DC as a much more creative and daring company than its distinguished competitors. comment widget complex logo Join the conversation on Complex today!

                   NS1:content=" AkitaOnRails explore by tag Beginner Career Management Philosophy Science Startups language Português English explore by tag Beginner Carrer Management Philosophy Science Startups language Português English Optimizing Linux for Slow Computers 2017 January 17, 18:15 h I've been researching a lot about Linux on the Desktop these days as you may see from my posts about Fedora 25 and Arch Linux (recommended!). There are some things you must have in mind when migrating to Linux systems. Even if you have a top of the line Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake, 32GB of RAM, 2TB M.2 SSDs, you may still benefit from the optimizations I will talk about. One of the best resources is Arch Linux's Wiki page on &quot;Improving Performance&quot;. You don't need everything there but it's a comprehensive resource that any enthusiast must read. htop and iotop It's about Responsiveness, not performance! Most people's concerns are first about performance, and this is a mistake. Linux is plenty fast, but for many people it doesn't feel like so in the Desktop. When tuning a server, you'll really want to tweak for performance and high throughput. That's where most Linux configurations really shine over the competition: they come better tuned to get the most out of server configurations. But in a Desktop you don't want that. For example, you're copying a 20GB file to your old USB thumb drive, or you're unzipping a large file, or you're compiling that large package from source, or you leave Dropbox in the background syncing gigabytes of files from their servers. Or you're doing &quot;nothing&quot; (in the foreground at least, but Gnome Tracker is heavily indexing your files in the background) and your environment stutters, hangs for a few seconds, and keeps doing that every so often. And you're left wondering why Linux is so bad compared to Windows or macOS where you don't see the same behavior on similar hardware. There is a term that is still misunderstood: real-time. Being real-time does not mean &quot;computing super fast&quot;, it means &quot;being predictable&quot;. If something needs to happen in a certain frequency, it doesn't matter if each cycle takes 1 second as long as it consistently takes the same 1 second - in all deadlines. If you have a &quot;fast&quot; machine that computes faster at 10 milliseconds every cycle, but every so often, randomly hangs for a couple of seconds, this is not real-time. And for media creation, it's a disaster. There is hard real-time where one peak or valley can be considered a catastropic failure, and soft real-time where you can handle a few peaks, but not so much. Hard real time requirements are rare, unless you're developing systems for nuclear plants you may miss a few deadlines. Most responsiveness issues are related to soft real-time situations. You can handle a few sparse peaks here and there, but no more than a few. And this is how you should do your research: not Googling for &quot;linux performance&quot; but for &quot;linux real-time&quot; or &quot;linux responsiveness&quot;. You will also find that there are niche professionals with special distros just for audio recording and editing, for example AVLinux or KXStudio. macOS is particularly good for media creators precisely because it's highly tuned for soft real-time, which is critical for software such as Logic Pro. And for the same reason, it's poor server OS. You will notice that the default Quicktime screen recording is super smooth, you rarely see stutters. But you don't need to use an audio specific distro or a hard real-time kernel. Critical audio distros don't use PulseAudio, but normal users will not be so concerned about it. We can tune it to find a good balance between responsiveness and performance. If you really want to go hard-core, you may want to read the Linux Audio Wiki on Real Time, but it's out of the scope of this article. What are the real Bottlenecks? A &quot;slow&quot; computer is not necessarily sporting old CPUs. I am doing my tests on a very old Lenovo Thinkcentre Edge 71z tower desktop. It has an old 2nd generation Intel Core 2.4Ghz 4 cores SandyBridge CPU. We just saw the release of the 7th generation Kaby Lake processors, so one might assume that nothing would run on such an old CPU, but you would be wrong. CPU is usually not serious a bottleneck unless you're doing really intensive computation, such as video compression, data sciences, genetics, neural networks, etc. For a casual user or even a heavy-weight developer, any processor better than the 1st generation Intel Core series is plenty. GPU is also rarely a bottleneck unless you're doing heavy gaming or 4K renderings. Most of the time you don't really need a USD 7000 dedicated GTX 1080. By the way, this is not necessary for most systems, but just to be on the safe side do this: 1 2 sudo pacman -S mesa-demos glxinfo | grep direct You should see direct rendering: Yes. If not, refer to your distro documentation, because this means you're not compositing through the GPU and you're wasting CPU cycles rendering your screen! If you try to measure your CPU and GPU usages, you will realize that most of the time they are actually idle! That's right, you're mostly underusing your machine cores. The bottleneck usually boils down to I/O. RAM vs SWAP Now, you're opening your shiny Chromium browser. Anyone fooling around for a few minutes will open an average of a dozen or more tabs, without breaking a sweat. It's super easy to eat up all 8GB of the average machines. Whenever that happens, the OS will have to start offloading data to disk, which is orders of magnitude slow. If application data is offloaded to disk and you alt-tab to it later, the OS will reach a &quot;page fault&quot;, and it will have to load from disk, from the swap file/partition. And again, this will have the effect of blocking your actions. The environment may stutter for a second or more, making it unresponsive. The very first thing you may want to do is install an extension such as The Great Suspender. It will simply close all tabs but the one you're reading right now. When you change to another tab it will reload it. The effect is that you're not using RAM if you really don't need to. The Great Suspender This extension alone can save you a couple of GIGABYTES of RAM, which is no small thing if you have 8GB or less. The other thing to consider is that Linux comes pre-configured to balance out offloading application data to swap to accomodate filesystem cache. So, if you're unzipping a large file, some of that data will go to RAM cache and application data will move to the disk. After you finish unzipping, you alt-tab to applications and boom: page faults, unresponsiveness. So you want to configure the OS to more aggressively keep your application state in RAM, and this is how you do it: 1 2 3 4 sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf &lt;&lt;-EOF vm.swappiness=1 vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50 EOF While on the topic of storage, you will find some older kernels making your machine become unresponsive when dealing with slower storage, such as USB drives or SD cards. This is how you tweak it: 1 2 3 4 sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf &lt;&lt;-EOF vm.dirty_background_bytes=16777216 vm.dirty_bytes=50331648 EOF If you don't want to reboot right now, you can run this in a Terminal: 1 2 3 4 sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=1 sudo sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50 sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_background_bytes=16777216 sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_bytes=50331648 Don't go too far on tuning, for example, never disable a file system journaling. It increases performance at the risk of putting your data in risk of corruption. Schedulers Why was &quot;Linux not ready for the Desktop&quot; years ago? Because it took too many years to finally start tackling low latency, inexpensive thread switching, better scheduling. You have to thank Con Kolivas, Ingo Molnár, Thomas Gleixner. The Linux kernel development is known to be super difficult to deal with and Con Kolivas is one of its victims, but his work live on to allow us to have better Desktop experiences these days. There are Process Schedulers and I/O Schedulers. The first is responsible to manage the Preemption of the kernel, how it switches between different computational tasks, the low-level equivalent of you &quot;alt-tabbing&quot; through apps, so to speak. I/O Schedulers deal with sharing slow I/O resources with competing processes needing to read from disk, write to RAM, etc. The recent history of process scheduler for the Desktop boils down to Con Kolivas' works on fair scheduling, leading to Ingo Mólnar's Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) which is the default in most distros nowadays and the continuing work of Kolivas on Staircase, Rotating Staircase Deadline, Staircase Deadlineee, Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS), and the most recent Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler (MuQSS). Then there are I/O Schedulers. For the most part you will be dealing with the Completely Fair Queueing (CFQ). Most development on this side is attributed to Jens Axboe, also responsible for the Deadline Scheduler and Noop Scheduler. Then there is the controversial evolution called Budget Fair Queueing (BFQ). When you have SSDs (and this is why you want SSDs), you will more likely choose NOOP (or Deadline) just because there is no need to waste computation time managing complex I/O queues for SSDs as they can easily handle up to tens of thousands of I/O operations concurrently without breaking a sweat. But if you have to use mechanical hard-drives, particularly the old and super slow 5.400rpm ones, you will want to manage the I/O queue efficiently, touching the spinning plates as little as possible. And in this case, you will really want to use something like BFQ (or at least leave it at the default CFQ). You can check which I/O Scheduler you're running like this: 1 2 $ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler noop deadline cfq [bfq] In the example above you will see that [bfq] is the one active, but you can change it on the fly to test it out if you want. To take advantage of those newest schedulers to better optimize slow computers, your best bet is to install Linux Zen kernel, a version of Liquorix. It includes de MuQSS scheduler instead of CFS and BFQ instead of CFQ, while also adding more tweaks for responsiveness like proper QoS over TCP to avoid TCP congestion. In Arch Linux it's a simple thing to do: 1 2 sudo pacman -Sy linux-zen sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg For Ubuntu, you may want to refer to Liquorix's Install Page as it depends on your CPU, but most likely you will install on 64-bit machines: 1 2 sudo apt-get install liquorix-keyring apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-amd64 linux-headers-liquorix-amd64 Is GNOME 3 too slow? I always heard that GNOME and even KDE are too slow, you should just use XFCE (or LXQt, or MATE). And it always striked me as one of those things people just keep repeating until it becomes the official canon. As an engineer, I dislike thinking that way. Defying the canon is more like what an engineer should do. GNOME 3.22 is an ever evolving environment and ecosystem. It's good looking by default, no need to tweak it too much. And it has several built-in conveniences such as GNOME Online Accounts, Tracker for indexing files and making them easily searchable, GNOME Photos that sync from Google Photos, and so on. Every nicety we like about a system like macOS. Convenience is a trade-off of performance and responsiveness. So high-end machines will benefit from the convenience and old machines will suffer because of the extra &quot;bloat&quot; in the background. How do you maintain some of the convenience on old hardware? Again, you must understand what's going on. The first thing you must install is htop and iotop. The first is good to see what processes running in the background may be eating up your CPU or RAM. The second is good to see what processes are bloating your I/O queues doing background file/network operations. What I found out in my system were 2 main offenders: Dropbox and Tracker. iotop Dropbox is optional, but most people nowadays use it. Out of the box it is a hidious monster, one of the worst pieces of software you're obligated to live with. The first time you install and it has to download everything, your machine will go down to its knees. Nothing to do about that, just remember to install it Friday night and leave it running in the office over the weekend. Then, edit the /usr/share/applications/dropbox.desktop and replace the Exec=dropbox line with this: 1 Exec=ionice -c 3 -n 7 dropbox start -i &amp;&amp; cpulimit -b -e dropbox -l 10 This &quot;should&quot; tune down Dropbox to have the least amount of CPU time and only have I/O when the system is idle. Another way is to install Ananicy. It is a daemon that promises to automatically set NICE and IOCLASS of selected processes just like using ionice and cpulimit above. You can install it in Arch like this: 1 sudo pacaur -S ananicy-git And if you cat /etc/ananicy.d/dropbox.rules you will see a rule set like this: 1 2 # Dropbox client: https://www.dropbox.com NAME=dropbox NICE=19 IOCLASS=idle Which is basically what we did in the Exec line tweak. I didn't test Ananicy enough but if it does what's promised, it's even easier as it comes with pre-configured rules for applications such as make, VLC, transmission, etc. Then, there is Tracker. The purpose of this tool is to index your files so you can search them fast and easily through GNOME applications such as the Nautilus File Manager. Again, the first time you install your new GNOME environment it will be very expensive to build the first index pass, specially if you're downloading tons of files from Dropbox. Do it on a Friday night! But you should also tune it down to only run when your system is idle. Run Alt-F2 and type tracker-preferences, then configure it to look like this: tracker-preferences In the same applet, also configure it to ignore log directories and *.log file patterns! Only those 2 things should make your machine WAY more responsive when using slow mechanical drives. I noticed that gnome-photos keeps running in the background and consuming some I/O, it is probably trying to sync your online photos from Google if you set GNOME Online Accounts. Dropbox, Tracker, Gnome-Photos, will all cause your initial experience to suck. But if you have patience - and a fast internet connection - they should settle down after the initial heavy sync. GNOME has other services in the background, namely: 1 2 3 4 5 6 gnome-session gnome-shell gnome-settings-daemon gnome-online-accounts evolution-data-server gjs-console There must be more depending on optional apps you installed. Gnome-Shell and GJS are easily the worst of the bunch. You can't do much about them because they're the Core of GNOME. GJS in particular enables Javascript-based extensions and everything Javascript is slow. The only thing you can do is avoid installing too many GNOME Extensions. By the way, if you install XFCE along-side GNOME, you may be surprised that many of the same background services will start up in the background! Install one or the other, not both in the same system. On the other hand, a bare-bone Arch install with the XFCE4 package set will start up consuming around 150MB of RAM!! But of course, you lose all the niceties that comes pre-installed with GNOME. And also of course: you start Chromium, open a few tabs, and there goes all the RAM anyway. If your goal is just to save resources, the choice is not between XFCE or LXQt, it is between having Facebook permanently opened in a browser tab or not. The reality is that the main offender of RAM is the Web as a whole. Half a dozen tabs and you eat up more than 1 Gigabyte, and it keeps going up. That's why my main first recommendation is to install The Great Suspender. You will run far worst apps in the foreground. For example, Spotify, Franz, Atom, to name a few. If it's a hybrid app that load a browser to load a web application, it is going to be heavy. And I'd choose a forward thinking desktop manager that already supports Wayland/Weston instead of X11. You do want to throw away the bad X11 legacy as soon as possible. Summary As a shorter TL;DR remember to do the following: Tune your swappiness and cache pressure settings to avoid page faults when using your foreground applications. It's a trade-off of performance vs responsiness. Install the Linux-Zen or Liquorix kernels (depending on your distro) to have access to the better MuQSS process scheduler and BFQ I/O schedulers. If you're using an SSD you will want to check if you're using NOOP or Deadline I/O schedulers instead. Also check for TRIM support. Make Dropbox and Tracker play nice with your system. Configure both to only run when You are not using the system (when idle). Maybe install Ananicy and rejoice. Do not choose a Desktop Manager because of performance concerns. If you're using Chromium or other web based applications, you're already doomed. So don't panic and use GNOME 3.22. When I installed both Fedora 25 and Arch Linux I felt them sluggish. When I used Ubuntu 14.04 for months in a better hardware, I also felt it sluggish compared to macOS in similar hardware, but I never attempted this level of tunig before. The main reason being the heavy initial sync of applications such as Dropbox, Tracker, Gnome-Photos. The second reason is the better tuning of I/O scheduling and Swap settings because of the use of a mechanical harddrive. If you use an SSD you probably don't suffer nearly as much. Bottomline: if you can, buy a good SSD. If you have PCI Express x4, then do even better and buy a M.2 SSD such as the Samsung 950 EVO M.2. The best thing you can do is have more than 8GB of RAM (16GB being a good sweet spot) and a really fast SSD (preferably with a BUS that don't suffer from SATA 3's bottlenecks). With all the tweaks and tunings, I am happy to report that my years old Lenovo tower is running as smoothly as it can, being responsive enough even in higher loads, with this shit slow mechanical hard drive. And as a bonus, if you choose to stay in GNOME 3, install the nice Flat Plat theme, heavily inspired by Material Design, and the Paper or Moka icon sets. tags: linux kernel arch Comments Por favor habilite Javascript para visualizar os comentários disponibilizados pelo Disqus. comentários deste blog disponibilizados por Disqus © 2006-2022 Fabio Akita.

[Show] Marvel Comics Founded 1939[source?] Founder(s) Martin Goodman Headquarters New York City, New York Parent organization Marvel Entertainment Subsidiaries Epic Comics, Marvel UK, The Razor Line, Star Comics Official website marvel.com (Source) Established in 1939 by Martin Goodman as a subsidiary for Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Comics, over time, grew into one of the largest and most successful comic book companies on the planet. Even though they are well known for their role in the superhero industry, they were also the first company to release comic books for the Star Wars saga, with their first crack at the franchise being their Star Wars run, which ran from 1977 all the way until 1986. After reacquiring the license in 2015, Marvel once again became the primary publisher of Star Wars comics, with their latest series being the Star Wars 2020 run, which is currently ongoing.

Marvel began in 1939 as Timely Comics, publishing popular superhero titles. In the 1950s, as Atlas Comics they published mainly other genres such as romance, crime, western, and war stories. By the 1960s, the superhero genre was becoming popular again, and the newly named Marvel Comics started creating a number of new superhero titles written by Stan Lee and illustrated by Jack Kirby. During the 1970s Marvel's sales were declining and the company was in trouble caused, in part, by poor distribution. In the late 1970s, Marvel Comics President, Stan Lee, was approached by Charles Lippincott to produce a Star Wars comic as a promotion. Lee was highly reticent with the proposal for the project considering the film was still in production, until his protege, Roy Thomas, persuaded him otherwise. Even then Lee, citing the poor sales history of comic book adaptations, negotiated a quota of 100,000 copies to be sold before any royalties to Lucasfilm could be discussed.[1] The resulting series turned out to be smash success, in 1977 after prodding by Roy Thomas, as well as burgeoning successes like The Uncanny X-Men and Daredevil. Jim Shooter, editor-in-chief of Marvel from 1978 to 1987, would later say in an interview regarding the importance of Star Wars to the plight of the company, &quot;Star Wars single-handedly saved Marvel... And that kept us alive.&quot; [2] The only downside was that that 100,000 quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate royalty arrangments from a position of strength.[1] Marvel also published stories in Britain under the imprint Marvel UK. In addition to reprinting the American Star Wars comics, the UK series produced a number of original stories. Marvel continued to publish Star Wars comics until 1986, and the Droids and Ewoks series until 1987. The comic-book license for Star Wars was later picked up by Dark Horse Comics, which began producing Star Wars comics in 1991 with the publication of Star Wars: Dark Empire. Dark Horse would later reprint much of the Marvel-produced Star Wars material under the title Classic Star Wars. In 2009, Marvel was bought by The Walt Disney Company. Their former collaborator, Lucasfilm Ltd., followed suit three years later, when George Lucas sold the rights to his company to Disney. On January 3, 2014, an announcement was made that the Star Wars comics license was moving from Dark Horse back to Marvel in 2015.[3] Published series Legends Series Star Wars (April 1977 – June 1986;

                   NS1:content=" Python 编程 5 年后，我转向了 Go！ 2019-05-092019-05-09 16:56:35阅读 4140 作者 | Elad Leev 译者 | 姜松浩 责编 | 屠敏 本文转自 CSDN（ID：CSDNNews） 作为如今火了半边天的动态语言 Python ，凭借着较强的灵活性、可移植、可扩展等特性广受开发者喜爱。但是和 Google 的第二款开源编程语言 Go 相比，Python 的性能完全处于较弱一方。 在此局面下，“弃 Python 而拥抱 Go”的言论不绝于耳，但是我们究竟该怎么做才能迁移成功？其中又有哪些值得关注的点？在本文中，作者不论语言好坏，只谈从 Python 到 Go 的经验分享，希望对大家有所裨益。 以下为译文： 我喜欢Python。在过去的五年里，它一直是我的首选语言。Python非常友好并且易于学习，同时还保持着超级的效率。 从创建简单的脚本和Web开发，到数据可视化和机器学习，你几乎可以随时使用它。 但随着Go的逐渐成熟、强大的用户基础，以及越来越多的公司在经过成功的基准测试后决定转向Go的事实，使我更加广泛地阅读了Go，同时思考如何将其添加到我的工具集中并将它的好处应用到我的工作当中。 这篇文章不会讨论Python或Go哪种编程语言更好，线上有很多关于这个主题的帖子和比较，而且我认为这种问题在很大程度上取决于项目。 在这篇文章中，我将告诉你我从Python到Go的旅程，并为你提供一些技巧，让你了解一些帮助我在这次旅程中取得成功的资源。 01 我遇到的主要差异 当然，作为第一步，我浏览了令人叹为观止的官方“Tour Of Go”（https://tour.golang.org/welcome/），这确实让我有了良好的关于Go语法的基础知识。 为了加强这些知识，我阅读了电子书Go for Python Programmers（https://golang-for-python-programmers.readthedocs.io/），这使我能够继续下一步，尝试和失败，我认为这是最具教育意义的。 我使用了以前在Python中使用的常用函数，如JSON序列化或使用HTTP调用，并尝试在Go中编写它们。 通过在Go中应用来自Python中的类似概念，同时仍然包含语言的静态特性，我遇到了Go和Python之间的一些关键性的差异。 1.项目布局 首先，Python典型的不需要特定的目录层次结构，而Go则另外需要。 Go使用“标准”布局，这种布局稍微复杂一点，这使得增加了更多的工作，但好处是拥有结构良好的代码基础。这种代码基础鼓励模块化代码，并在项目规模扩大时仍能保持有序性。 官方的“How to Write Go Code”（https://golang.org/doc/code.html）有一个部分可以解释如何构建你的工作区。 2.静态和强类型 Go是一种静态类型的语言，由于你习惯使用Python或Ruby等动态类型语言，因此最初会让你感到不舒服。 毫无疑问，动态语言更容易出错，并且在输入验证方面需要花费更多精力来防止常见语法错误或解析错误。思考一个函数，他是计算两个整数之和的函数，但实际上你并不能保证使用此函数的用户不会将字符串传递给函数，因此这就会导致TypeError。 这种情况不会发生在Go中，因为你需要声明每个变量的类型，也就是说你的函数可以获得哪种类型的变量，以及函数将返回哪种类型的变量。 起初它有点烦人，感觉它让我的编码速度慢了很多，但是在很短的时间的阅读和编写Go的代码后，你发现已经习惯它了，它实际上可以节省时间，并使你的代码更加的鲁棒。 3.天生的并发性 Go具有天生的并发特性它支持使用goroutines和channel，这些可以使并发非常的方便。 首先，channel的概念可能有点棘手，并且很容易将其视为某种数据结构或排队实现。但是，经过一些阅读后，它们变得更加直白，你可以真正享受它们带来的价值，并充分利用它们。 如下是，一个简单的可视化的goroutines和channel： package main func main() { // create new channel of type int ch := make(chan int) // start new anonymous goroutine go func() { // send 42 to channel ch &lt;- 42 }() // read from channel &lt;-ch } 有关更多示例，请查看Hootsuite real life implementation（http://code.hootsuite.com/golang-routines-and-channels/），或者查看这个（https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/10/the-behavior-of-channels.html），一个来自ArdanLabs的优秀解释。 4.使用JSON 好吧，不再有json.loads()给你使用。 在Python中，反序列化JSON对象非常简单，只需使用json.loads就可以了！ 但是在Go中，作为一种静态类型语言，这种简单的操作可能会更复杂。 在Go中，你将JSON解析为之前定义的结构。任何不适合结构的字段都将被忽略，这是一件好事。这可以将其视为双方之间的一种预定义协议。这种方式下，你不需要对JSON中收到的数据感到“吃惊”，并且JSON字段和类型需要由双方“同意”。 { “first”: “Elad”, “last”: “Leev”, “location”:”IL”, “id”: “93” } type AccountData struct { First string `json:&quot;first&quot;` Last string `json:&quot;last&quot;` Location string `json:&quot;location&quot;` ID string `json:&quot;id&quot;` } 当然，你仍然可以在没有结构的情况下反序列化JSON，但是如果可能的话应该避免使用它，毕竟拥抱语言的静态性总归是更好的。 为了更好地理解Go中的JSON编码，你可以查看这篇文章（https://gobyexample.com/json），或使用“Go By Example”（https://gobyexample.com/json），“Go By Example”是你将拥有的终极备忘资源。 太懒了，不愿意把你的JSON转换成Go结构？没问题 - 这个工具会帮你做（https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/）。 5.清洁的代码 Go编译器将始终尽力保持代码清洁。 Go编译器将未使用的变量视为编译错误，而且，Go采用了独特的方法让机器处理大多数格式问题。 Go将在保存或编译时运行gofmt程序，它将处理大多数格式问题。 你不关心其中一个变量？再次 - 没问题！只需使用_（下划线）并将其分配给空标识符就可以了。 包含Go格式信息的必读文档是“Effective Go”（https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html）。 我的旅程还在继续 02 找到合适的库和框架 我真的习惯了我的Python框架和库，如Flask，Jinja2，Requests还有Kazoo，我真的很担心我找不到一个适合Go的。 但是你可以猜到，Go这个伟大的社区拥有自己独特的库，甚至可以让你完全忘记以前的库。 以下是我的一些偏好- Python Requests =&gt; net / http 内置的net / http 提供了非常棒的HTTP客户端和服务器实现，而且非常易于使用。 Flask + Jinja2=&gt; Gin Gin是一个HTTP Web框架，其中包含非常简单的API - 路径中的参数，上传文件，分组路径（/ api / v1，/ api / v2），自定义日志格式，服务静态文件，HTML转化以及功能强大的自定义中间件。 可以看看这个benchmark（https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md）。 CLI Creation=&gt; Cobra Cobra是一个用于创建功能强大的CLI应用程序的库，同时也是用于生成应用程序和命令文件的程序。 最广泛使用的Go项目中许多都是使用Cobra构建的，包括Kubernetes、etcd还有OpenShift。 我强烈推荐的其他一些库是：Viper，Gonfig还有Awsome-Go。 03 其他资源 以下是一些其他的资源，这些资源在我的Go之旅中能够显著的帮助到我。 Francesc Campoy（https://twitter.com/francesc）- 你肯定需要查看他的YouTube频道和GitHub资料（https://github.com/campoy）。 Francesc也有一些很多伟大的工作，例如Go Tooling in Action（https://github.com/campoy/go-tooling-workshop）和Web Applications Workshop（https://github.com/campoy/go-web-workshop）。 GopherCon Videos（https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9QVEApa5BKLw9r8cnOFEA/playlists，需访问外国网站） Go Web Examples（https://gowebexamples.com/） Golang Weekly（https://twitter.com/golangweekly）, Gopher Academy（https://twitter.com/GopherAcademy）, Golang News（https://twitter.com/golangnews）的 Twitter账户（需访问外国网站）。 04 总结 作为一名使用五年Python的狂热分子，我担心过渡到Go会很痛苦。 但我真的很兴奋，看到有一个真正强大的社区，能够贡献和维护优秀的资源。这样的社区可以帮助你顺利过渡到Go。 Go是当今发展最快的编程语言之一，我希望将来Go能够成为Google编写云应用程序和基础架构的首选语言。 对Go来说这是一个激动人心的时刻，我鼓励大家去看看，并且成为Gophers！ 本文转自 CSDN（ID：CSDNNews） 原文： https://medium.com/appsflyer/my-journey-from-python-to-go-3859783c6b3c " />

                   NS1:content=" 小鹤双拼、小鹤音形入门 踏迫 踏迫 屋顶，阳光，啤酒，自由 新手一定要看文末！ 全拼：我们平时打字的方式叫做全拼，因为打一个字要把它所有的字母都打出来，打出一个字要2-6键，例如：鹤he，双shuang 双拼：双拼则是所有字每个只用2个按键就能打出的一种输入方式，如小鹤双拼：双ul(u代表sh，l代表uang)，而小鹤双拼是众多双拼方案中的一种， 小鹤音形：双拼打出的只是一个字的音，如何快速的确定这个字呢，比如：he和何河合喝盒……我们可以通过这个字的偏旁部首快速的确定这个字，这种方法就是小鹤音形 小鹤双拼·小鹤音形 - 官方网站 (flypy.com)官网有学习交流群，小鹤的作者就在里面 小鹤音形编码查询 (xhup.club) 小鹤双拼 &amp; 小鹤音形 (ysepan.com)小鹤双拼、小鹤音形网盘 小鹤双拼在Android，iOS，Windows，MacOS，Linux这五个平台都是可以用的，也就是手机、平板、电脑所有平台都能用，同时搜狗、讯飞、百度、QQ、手心、irime这些输入法也都可以用 小鹤音形Android和Windows可以用，iOS和MacOS可不可以用我不清楚，没用过 练习方式，微信里搜索下面这三个小程序 双拼练习，小鹤双拼练习，极速云跟打 我个人学习双拼3天就可以不用看键位，但是打字比较慢，7天明显快了很多，一个月可以不思考直接打，3个月我就极其的熟练了 音形呢，我个人学习音形2天就上手了，遇到不懂的字就去小程序里查，很容易上手的 小鹤双拼键位 小鹤音形键位 如果你是刚刚知道双拼，并且打算学习小鹤双拼，结果看到这两张图就觉得小鹤双拼太难了，那你是误会了，第二个小鹤音形是小鹤双拼的进阶，可学可不学，对人没影响的，有人只用小鹤双拼也可以打字特别快 平时打字比如窗前明月光，chuang qian ming yue guang，5+4+4+3+5+1（空格），一共要敲22下键盘，听着噼里啪啦的实际没打几个字。而小鹤双拼只需要2×5+1（空格）=11下 比如王（wang），小鹤是把ang放到一个按键上（h），于是打王这个字就变成了w加一个字母（wh），所有字都是第一个音和后面的音，于是就可以所有的字都用两个按键打出来。 双拼没什么，不过是把几个字母放到一个按键上，在最开始的几天大家都会很郁闷很痛苦，因为不知道要按哪个，会反反复复的看键位图，但是过了那几天，自己不用看图就能打出来的时候，你就会体验到打字的美妙，你会发现脑子有点跟不上打字的速度了，因为打字变快大脑反应的时间变短了，你会发现以前的自己打字原来这么慢 如果你已经熟悉小鹤双拼了，往下看，不熟悉也没关系，就当是看熟悉小鹤双拼以后接下来会怎么办 最开始，我们用双拼打字还不算快的时候，打字没有什么节奏感，慢慢的，当我们熟悉以后，打字的速度越来越快，可是却发现有很多时候要停下来去找一个字，这种被打断的感觉很不爽，我都打字这么快了我还要停下来找个字？为了去掉这种不爽，小鹤音形出现了 想学双形首先要下载官网输入法，手机电脑都是， 首先，小鹤音形前两码是音码，后两码是形码（这个字拆开，形码是这个字的首码和末码），拼音加字形确定这个汉字，这样就不用翻着找字了，特别是打古文的时候，优势就出来了。 我说一下音码和形码的键盘布局，音码布局原理是打字舒服，形码就不一样了，形码是为了好记 为什么说这个布局方便记忆呢，我举例，形码表上多数都是和那个字母的拼音有关的，比如第一个q，反犬旁，quan，那就放在q里，反文旁，wen，那就放在w里，单人旁，ren，那就放在r里。 你看了一遍后发现有的不是，比如o，那是形状像的，比如k，开口的都发放在这里， 那h呢，那个四点底，那个是火的意思，huo， 如果理解了那用小程序小鹤双拼练习， 我说一下如何使用，第一个查询用来查字， 第三个更多里的部件/小字键位练习用来熟练形码键位也经常遇到的小字 如果熟练了就用第二个练习，如果特别熟练了就用小程序极速云跟打， 表你看能懂了，那表下面那么多字是什么，也需要背吗？不用背，小字当成偏旁部首就行 具体看官网，官网就说的特别详细了 我再举个例子，我是中国人 用形码，不会要5×4打20个键吧，不用，小鹤音形不会因为你哪个字用的多了就改变顺序，不用联网都可以，那具体几个键？ 我，按w第一个字就是我，那么打出我就是w，空格确认，是，按u空格确认， 中国，vsgo，像是这种词语只需要打音码 人，按r空格确认 那么像是指导，知道，直到这种同音的呢， 打vidc自己出来的就是指导 打vd就出来知道了 打直到是vda，这个a是什么，熟悉形码你知道a是横，这个a是词语第二个字打首码，因为词语有重复，所以有些码叫随心所欲码，就是为了打一些词，也不是很多，只有这几个 如果你想系统的练习打字，可以下载跟打器，比如添雨跟打器，极速跟打器等等，练习常用字前500,还有熟悉一简字和二简词，就是按一个字母出现字的顺序是不变的，用久了就知道按哪个字母出哪个字，小鹤还有二简词，就是两个字母出来的词语也是固定的，用久了会很快，当然也有记忆量， ∴ ☆·°.·°∴ ☆·°.·°∴ ☆·°.·°∴ ☆·°.·°∴ ☆·°.·°∴ ☆·°.·°∴ ☆·°.·° 文末： 开篇我就让大家看这里，是想告诉大家打字这条路， 让我先说一些基础知识， 击键：就是你每秒按键盘的次数，比如3击键就是你一秒按了3次键盘 码长：就是你打一个字要按几次键，这个数据多数是统计打一篇文章平均的码长 上屏：打完这个字的音按空格确定这个字，把字打在屏幕上，这个就叫上屏 顶功：就是打后面的字把前面的字顶上去 我开始说，小鹤双拼有什么优点， 1、他不用携带，随便一个人的手机电脑随便一个人的输入法你都能临时设置成小鹤双拼（对比五笔等其他输入法，要用自己的软件才可以） 2、小鹤双拼遇到想不起来怎么写的字或词，也不用去找，打出来再翻就好了（同样是为了提高打字效率，有很多输入法，比如五笔，但是那些输入法却做不到这一点，还有些词自己只知道读音，而其他的那些输入法做不到） 3、它可以搭配小鹤音形 打字，究竟打到什么地步才算可以了呢，日常使用40-60字/min，办公60-120字/min，办公室打字的文员，复印店前台120-220字/min，也有很多用了一辈子五笔的人速度达到了240-260字/min， 那么小鹤双拼可以达到这个速度吗，答案是可以的，小鹤分三种打字方式，一种是小鹤双拼，一种是小鹤音形，一种是小鹤双拼挂接形码辅助码， 双拼打字应该是一句一句的打，这样联想的才会更准确，自己掌握好短句就足够的精准，也不要打完一句话就空格上屏，而是应该打完一句话用，。这两个符号来上屏，这样打字是最有节奏的 音形打字，贵在盲打，掌握好一简字，二简字，就可以实现盲打，而且音形是自动上屏的，就不需要再按空格，可以节省大量的空格键 最后一种音形挂接形码辅助码就是我在用的，打短字可以用形码来确定这个字，打长句又可以直接用双拼，不必像双拼那样找字，也不必像音形那样痛苦的记忆那么多二简字，而且算下来也没省下几个按键， 这三种说完了，可以发现只有第二个和第三个是可以确定自己要打的字的，才可以实现盲打， 实际上，小鹤音形和小鹤双拼挂接才是最后的两条路，而且这两条路最后都可以达到350字/min的水准，如果没达到那你不要怀疑是输入法不行，是你不行，要练的就是对输入法对键盘的熟悉程度，所有打字在200字/min以上的都是每秒6击键以上 还有那么多的输入法，难道就没有比小鹤强的吗，有，我说一些名字，最广为人知的五笔输入法，包括86版（使用人数多，因为那个时候都在学86，所以也是资源最多的，比如如何学86，相关的各种教程），98版（因为是先有的86后有的打字规范，所以这个98版就是让拆字变得更合理，同时也进行了一些优化），新世纪版（最新的一版，因为还有版权保护，收费，所以使用人数很少，而且也没前两个好，不要学） 除此之外，还有民间对五笔进行全方面优化的输入法，因为是09年发布的，所以叫做09五笔，分为091五笔和092五笔，这两个也是目前理论最快的输入法 还有大牛双拼小牛双拼加上辅助码，还有顶功的星空键道， 还有用2个笔画确定的二笔输入法，还有形码顶功的西风瘦码，还有参考了西风瘦码的灵形速影， 还有逸码，郑码，希码，徐码，水晶五笔，地下五笔，真码，声笔系列码，小兮码，蓝宝石等等，好多好多的，有的就是强调快，有的布局合理，有的上手极难，但是一旦上手就会很轻松，有的一开始就轻松 但是，他们有个共同点，包括小鹤，所有的输入法都能达到180字以上的速度，输入法没有什么打字速度的上限，没必要换来换去，我也用过很多，我可以负责的说，练小鹤吧，绝对是入手容易上限也高值得你用时间去练习的一个输入法 编辑于 2022-07-30 16:23 小鹤双拼输入法 双拼输入法 拼音输入法 " />

By Brian Cronin Published Jul 22, 2016 Share Share Tweet Email 0 Comment 10 &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; Star Trek 2013 Annual by John Byrne In 2013, IDW Publishing released the first of a series of stunning photo novels by comic book legend John Byrne. Byrne meticulously cropped and altered images from actual episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to tell new stories set in the original series. The first of these bizarre but amazing stories was published as an annual. The story was a sequel to the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; about Captain James T. Kirk dealing with his helmsman, Gary Marshal, becoming a powerful God-like creature. In this story, Kirk returned to the planet where Marshal was killed and buried, only to discover that Gary's spirit still lived and wanted revenge on Kirk for his corporeal death. It was stunning how well Byrne's foto-novel worked. 9 &quot;All the Infinite Ways&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; #13 (Marvel Volume 1) by Martin Pasko, Joe Brozowski, Tom Palmer and a bunch of inkers Writer Martin Pasko's greatest triumph in skirting Paramount's onerous licensing restrictions was this touching story involving Doctor McCoy running into his estranged daughter, Joanna, on a mission to a planet where the Klingons and the Federation were each trying to gain drilling rights. Joanna was referenced once in an episode of the original series, but perhaps Paramount either didn't notice or didn't care that Pasko worked her into this story. Adding to their estrangement, Joanna was engaged to a Vulcan! The other story involved the Klingons discovering that the ape-like inhabitants of the planet at issue used artificial means to become sentient and their plan was to destroy the factory that produced the devices that made them sentient, so that the Klingons could take over the planet (as they would not be held to a treaty if there was no intelligent life on the planet anymore). When the Klingons then took Joanna hostage, McCoy and Joanna's Vulcan fiance had to work together to save her and stop the Klingons. 8 &quot;The Worst of Both Worlds&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; #47-50 by Michael Jan Friedman, Peter Krause, Pablo Maros and Romeo Tanghal In this epic storyline, the Enterprise found itself stuck in a rift in time and space and ended up in a parallel universe. In this universe, the crew of the Enterprise was unable to save Captain Jean-Luc Picard from his fate as Locutus of the Borg. As a result of that failure, the Borg had assimilated Earth and used the planet as a home base to assimilate the rest of the universe. Only a small group of survivors, led by Captain William Riker (with a badass eyepatch), had prevented the Borg from making all resistance futile, as Riker's ship continued making guerrilla attacks on the Borg to distract them from the rest of the human resistance. The crew of &quot;our&quot; Enterprise agreed to help this universe stop the Borg. 7 &quot;The Trial of James T. Kirk&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; #7-12 (DC Volume 2) by Peter David, Jim Fry, Gordon Purcell and Arne Starr In this classic tale, Peter David managed to let the crew of the Enterprise finally come to terms with all the crazy events that had occurred in the film series from &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; through &quot;The Voyage Home,&quot; with Kirk having to stand trial for the Klingon that he killed in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; after first being hunted down by the bounty hunter Sweeney over said killing. The trial allowed David to reach deep into the &quot;Star Trek&quot; annals for many amusing callbacks. It was interesting to see Kirk finally have to perhaps pay the piper over his rather liberal take on the Prime Directive over the years. This arc also developed the intriguing Enterprise protocol officer R.J. Blaise, who had a fascinating relationship with Kirk -- he stood against everything she believed in, but also couldn't help but be attracted to him. It was a great dynamic and Blaise was a strong character. 6 &quot;The Final Voyage&quot; &quot;Star Trek Annual&quot; #2 (DC Volume 1) by Mike W. Barr, Dan Jurgens and Bob Smith Then-regular &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book writer Mike W. Barr handled this special look at the final mission of the Enterprise's fabled five-year mission (the previous year's annual had detailed the first mission in the five-year mission). On the way home to Earth to make way for the incoming crew (including new Captain Will Decker), the Enterprise found itself diverted to Talos IV, which the Klingons had secretly taken over. The Klingons tormented the crew by subjecting them to illusions created by the Talosians, forcing the crew to relive all their worst moments over the past five years. The Klingons erred, though, by pushing Kirk too far. This was a fine tribute to the end of a great (seemingly never-ending) five years. 5 &quot;Double Blind&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; #24-25 (DC Volume 1) by Diane Duane, Tom Sutton and Ricardo Villagran This story was set during the period between &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,&quot; where Admiral Kirk is in command of the Excelsior. This hilarious story involved the Excelsior being attacked by the insectoid race the Ajir, who are so incompetent that Kirk just allowed them to &quot;take over&quot; the Excelsior, knowing that they would not know what to do once they had the ship, and thus resolving things peacefully. However, another alien race, the Grond, then attacked the Ajir and also tried to take over the Excelsior. The Grond are essentially just kittens, so Kirk had to maneuver between two weak opponents without offending anyone or letting anyone get hurt. It's a really funny story and Duane had a few characters from her &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels appear in the comic. 4 &quot;New Frontiers&quot;/&quot;The Mirror Universe Saga&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; #9-16 (DC Volume 1) by Mike W. Barr, Tom Sutton and Ricardo Villagran This epic adventure took place right after &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,&quot; as Admiral Kirk and his crew are about to be brought in for court martial due to their actions during &quot;Star Trek III.&quot; However, things are interrupted by an invasion from the alternate universe known as the &quot;Mirror Universe&quot; from the classic original TV series episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror,&quot; where the heroic crew of the Enterprise are villains. The court martial was put on hold while Kirk and his crew repel the invasion, and readers saw Kirk travel to the alternate universe where he encountered the Mirror universe version of his son, David, who died in &quot;Star Trek III.&quot; It is a powerful storyline, filled with deep moments of characterization as well as some awesome action. By the end of the story, Barr managed to set the book up well for the status quo it would inhabit for thirty issues until after &quot;The Voyage Home.&quot; 3 &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; &quot;Star Trek: Debt of Honor&quot; by Chris Claremont, Adam Hughes and Karl Story In this original graphic novel (one of the first comic book works by Chris Claremont after his epic 17-year run on &quot;X-Men&quot; came to an end), we discover an alien race that keeps popping up throughout &quot;Star Trek&quot; history, but they manage to maintain their hidden nature, and only James Kirk knows that they are up to no good. Well, among the Federation, that is. Someone else who knew that the aliens were up to no good was a Romulan captain, T'Cel, who was basically Kirk's Romulan counterpart. Adam Hughes drew the heck out of T'Cel, as she was right up his stylistic alley. T'Cel and Kirk go rogue together to take down the alien threat. It's a wonderful tribute to the history of &quot;Star Trek&quot; by Claremont and Hughes and Story do a magnificent job on the art. 2 &quot;Once a Hero...&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; #19 (DC Volume 2) by Peter David, Gordon Purcell and Arne Starr In this heartfelt issue, Captain Kirk tried to come to grips with the death of one of the security officers on the Enterprise. Much has been said over the years about the anonymous &quot;red shirts&quot; who die while working as security officers on the Enterprise. David, then, chose to have that very anonymity called into question. What do you do with the death of someone who died to protect you but you know nothing about them? What kind of strange debt do you owe someone like that? Kirk is plagued by these thoughts when he realizes that no one else on the ship knew Ensign Lee, either. Kirk, though, very thoughtfully managed to find some sense of peace in Lee's passing, in what what David's final issue as the regular writer of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; ongoing series. 1 &quot;Retrospect&quot; &quot;Star Trek Annual&quot; #3 (DC Volume 1) by Peter David, Curt Swan and Ricardo Villagran Inspired by the famous Harold Pinter play, &quot;Betrayal,&quot; David did a tour de force writing performance in this one-shot examining the life and death of Montgomery Scott's wife, Glynnis Campbell. Using Pinter's backwards storytelling approach, David slowly pulled back the curtains on Scotty's relationship with Glynnis, with events taking place &quot;off panel&quot; at major events in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history, going all the way back to when he and Glynnis were children. It's a heartbreakingly thoughtful comic book, teaching us all that any character in a narrative can become the star of their own story, as Scotty is in this classic tale.

                   NS1:content=" Non-Canon: 10 Best Star Wars Legends Graphic Novels, Ranked By Scoot Allan Published Nov 09, 2019 Share Share Tweet Share Email While we're excited for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, we still can't help but love some of these great Legends/Expanded Universe graphic novels. Non-Canon 10 Best Star Wars Legends Graphic Novels Ranked As excited as Star Wars fans are for the upcoming finale to the Skywalker Saga, The Rise of Skywalker, there will always be a part of us that laments the new direction the franchise took with the new trilogy. This isn't to throw shade at the Age of Resistance storylines, only to reinforce our love of what could have been with the Star Wars Legends universe of stories. Legends was previously known as the Star Wars Expanded Universe and included stories from novels and video games that expanded on the mythology prior to Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and the new trilogy of characters. So to celebrate our love for these 'forgotten&quot; stories, today we are going to take a look at the best graphic novels set in the Star Wars Legends universe. 10 CLASSIC STAR WARS Comixology The term &quot;classic&quot; can get thrown around a lot undeservedly, but in the case of this Classic Star Wars collection, the term is very appropriate. Comics legends Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson began a Star Wars newspaper strip in 1981 which has been reformated and collected in this beautiful graphic novel. The newspaper strip took place between the events of the first two films in the original trilogy and followed Luke, Han, and Leia on a number of adventures that bridged the gap between the films. The collection even includes new and extended panels from Williamson to help with the reformatting of the stories. 9 SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE Comixology You might recognize the term Shadows of the Empire from a few different sources, as Lucasfilm explored the idea of a crossover multimedia event set in between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and was released across all mediums except film including comic books, video games, RPG board games, toys, and even a soundtrack. The event featured original trilogy characters (minus Han who was frozen in carbonite) and introduced new scoundrel Dash Rendar and the villainous Prince Xizor and his Black Sun organization. The Omnibus even includes the sequel to the story as well as the introduction of the fan-favorite Mara Jade in &quot;By The Emperor's Hand.&quot; 8 CRIMSON EMPIRE SAGA Comixology When the Imperial Royal Guard was first introduced in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi alongside Emperor Palpatine, as they served as elite loyal soldiers. The Imperial Guard were given extensive training and armed with Force Pikes and Vibro-lances. Star Wars: Crimson Empire follows Kir Kanos, the last surviving member of the Royal Guard, as he makes his way in a galaxy without an Emperor. Over the course of the saga, Kanos goes from honored Imperial officer to the most wanted man in the galaxy to bounty hunter, and he is instrumental in the fight against the next would-be Emperor to try and follow in Palpatine's footsteps. 7 INFINITIES Comixology Star Wars: Infinities might be the most non-canon of the Legends stories we're discussing today. The series took the What If...?! approach to the Star Wars universe and explored a few key events that may have gone differently if a few details had been changed. For instance, if Luke had died on Hoth, then it would have been Leia who went to Dagobah to train with Yoda. And in the ultimate what might have been scenario, George Lucas' original adapted screenplay The Star Wars is also included in this Infinities Epic Collection. 6 TAG &amp; BINK WERE HERE Comixology While most of the Star Wars Legends graphic novels we've been discussing have been fairly serious explorations of some of our favorite Star Wars characters, Tag and Bink Were Here is something completely different. Follow the comedic adventures of the Rebellion's worst/best agents as they find themselves involved in the epic battles seen in the original trilogy. Readers were introduced to Tag Greenley and Bink Otauna as they ran from the battle on Princess Leia's ship as she transports the plans to the Death Star, and are forced to hide in Stormtrooper costumes that get them into further hilarious trouble. This collection features all of their original trilogy adventures as well as their origins in the Clone Wars! 5 PURGE Comixology Everything changed for the Galactic Republic and the Star Wars universe in Revenge of the Sith when Chancellor Palpatine executed Order 66, which was a command programmed into each of the Clone Troopers as an emergency plan against rogue Jedi but was really Palpatine and the Sith's plan to bring down the Jedi Order. Star Wars Purge follows Darth Vader and the new Empire as they strengthen their control of the universe by fulfilling Order 66 and hunt down the last remaining Jedi's of the galaxy. There were a few Purge series that feature great battles between Vader and the surviving Jedi as he continues his evolution into the Dark Lord of the Sith fans first met in A New Hope. 4 KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC Comixology Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is still considered one of the best Star Wars video games that have ever been released, and its popularity has led to a number of spin-offs and sequels in various mediums, including the popular Knights of the Old Republic comic series that takes place before the events of the game. The comic series follows Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick who is framed for the murders of the other Padawans by the mysterious Jedi Covenant. Zayne would gather an interesting group of characters and even get involved in the Mandalorian War from the first game, further tying the two properties together. 3 DARK EMPIRE Star Wars Dark Empire Cover Luke Skywalker Holding Green Lightsaber Comixology Dark Empire was a Dark Horse comic series set after the events of Return of the Jedi as the Rebel Alliance is struggling to clear out the remaining Imperial Forces, who have strengthened after the appearance of a new leader. That new leader is revealed to be none other than Emperor Palpatine, returned in a cloned body and seeking a new dark apprentice. Not only is Dark Empire a beautiful display of art and storytelling, but it also became a part of the official Expanded Universe canon with the events eventually factoring into the novels. Dark Empire is memorable for showing Luke's corruption to the Dark Side and has also helped stoke the rumors surrounding Palpatine's return in The Rise of Skywalker. 2 LEGACY Comixology Jan Duursema and John Ostrander's Star Wars: Legacy avoided most of the continuity trappings of the Expanded Universe by setting their story over 100 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The story follows Cade, a descendant of Luke Skywalker who abandoned his Jedi training to become a pirate/smuggler/bounty hunter, so basically the coolest possible Jedi in the galaxy. Cade and his gang of fellow scoundrels are forced into a war against the new Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Crayt, and his usurped Empire. While the series was initially criticized for its huge jump forward chronologically and take on the Skywalker legacy, it would soon become a favorite among Star Wars fans thanks to great art, well-developed characters, and fantastic story. 1 HEIR TO THE EMPIRE Comixology One of the best and most highly-regarded Expanded Universe stories began in the novels from the legendary Timothy Zahn when he launched what would become known as the Thrawn saga with Heir to the Empire. Dark Horse released comic adaptations of all three novels, with Marvel grouping the three together in The Thrawn Trilogy. Heir to the Empire not only introduced Grand Admiral Thrawn into the Satr Wars mythology but also the previously-mentioned Mara Jade, and Han and Leia's force-sensitive twins, Jacen and Jaina. Much of the Expanded Universe was launched by Heir to the Empire, which was wonderfully adapted by Dark Horse.

The book reading experience on these devices depends on the reader’s software. This article will list various ebook management and reading apps for Linux. Some of these apps go beyond being simple readers and allow you to manage your entire digital book collection and convert them in different formats. Calibre Calibre is an all-in-one ebook management software that allows you to read, manage, and convert digital books. It supports a multitude of ebook file formats for both reading and conversion purposes. It can sync your book collection and reading progress across multiple devices. Calibre is a completely free and open-source app, being in development for over a decade. It is considered to be one of the most feature-packed and comprehensive ebook management suites available for desktop PCs. To install Calibre in Ubuntu, run the command below: $ sudo apt install calibre If there is no other ebook reader installed on your system, Calibre will automatically associate itself with popular ebook file formats like “epub”. You can launch the calibre reader by double-clicking on any valid ebook file format or you can right-click on the file, click on “Open With Other Application” and select e-book viewer app from the popup window. To launch the standalone Calibre ebook viewer app, click on the “E-book Viewer” app from the application launcher. Calibre ebook viewer supports user bookmarks, syncing reading progress, changing styles of the book, dictionary lookup, etc. You can access settings of the ebook by right-clicking on any ebook opened in the Calibre e-book viewer app. FBReader FBReader or “Favorite Book Reader” is an ebook reader for PC and mobile operating systems. Some of the features of FBReader include support for numerous ebook file formats, support for opening files directly from compressed archives, options for managing and organizing your ebook collection, syncing of reading progress, automatic justification and hyphenation of text, text search, CSS styling, cloud storage, cloud sync, a web-based viewer, etc. To install FBReader in Ubuntu, run the command below: $ sudo apt install fbreader KOReader KOReader is a free, open-source, and cross-platform ebook reader for desktop computers, mobiles, and other handheld devices.

Once you have downloaded the appropriate file, run one of the following commands (replace &lt;filename&gt;): $ sudo apt install &lt;filename&gt;.deb $ chmod +x &lt;filename&gt;.AppImage GNOME Books GNOME Books is available in the default repositories of most of the GNOME-based Linux distributions. The ebook reader is pretty basic and lacks many features compared to other readers mentioned in this article. However, its main focus is on providing a minimal and clutter-free user interface for reading books. If you want something that just works out of the box without hundreds of options, this app may be apt for you. To install GNOME books in Ubuntu, run the command below: $ sudo apt install gnome-books Foliate Foliate is a free and open-source ebook reader for Linux. It aims to provide a clean, modern, and distraction-free interface for reading books on desktop computers. Its feature set is on par with other popular ebook readers and includes all necessary options for changing the book styles and formatting, syncing the reading progress, user bookmarks, text search, dictionary lookup, and so on. Foliate also comes with basic text-to-speech support for ebooks, something that other desktop readers lack. To install Foliate in Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution, run the command below: $ sudo snap install foliate More installation options are available here. Conclusion These are some of the best ebook readers available for Linux. Most of the ebook reader software today is focused on mobile and handheld platforms, so not much activity is seen in desktop readers. Mobile devices also include Google’s accurate text-to-speech engine and have edge over desktop readers as they provide users the convenience of reading on the go.

By Thomas Bacon Published Nov 30, 2019 Share Share Tweet Email Comment Warning: SPOILERS for Star Trek: Countdown #1. An official tie-in prequel comic for Star Trek: Picard has finally revealed why its hero lost faith in the Federation. Adding a new layer to the seemingly bright future for the Star Trek franchise, with the return of Patrick Stewart to the popular role of Jean-Luc Picard. The Star Trek: Picard TV series is set towards the end of the 24th century, and the trailers have already made it clear that Jean-Luc has fallen from grace. Something has shaken his faith in the Federation, and he's retired to live at his the Picard family vineyard in La Barre, France. It's no doubt a lonely and isolated life, given his older brother Robert and his nephew Rene -- who previously lived there -- tragically died in a fire long ago. What could bring a man like Jean-Luc Picard to this grim ending? The answer will come as a surprise to fans. Related: Star Trek: What The Next Generation Crew Are Doing When Picard Begins IDW has just published an official tie-in comic for Star Trek: Picard, which subtly links in to other comics published in 2009 to coincide with JJ Abrams' big-screen relaunch of Star Trek. And all these tie-ins finally provide an answer. The Star Trek: Picard prequel comic, Countdown, is set in the year 2385, two years before the destruction of Romulus in a devastating supernova. Although the Romulan Empire had attempted to keep the impending disaster a secret, the Federation's own scientists had discovered it, and Admiral Picard takes point on persuading Romulans to accept help. Admiral Picard Tie-In Comic He was personally coordinating evacuation efforts across the entire Romulan Empire, battling against the Romulans' natural secrecy and distrust of outsiders in order to help everybody he possibly could. This is Picard as he's never been seen before, at the very height of his career, facing one of the greatest challenges Starfleet has ever had to deal with. Starfleet is demonstrating its altruism on a cosmic scale, investing a phenomenal amount of time and resources in a desperate attempt to evacuate the bulk of the Romulan Empire before it is destroyed. They're working to a ticking clock, but it's impossible to accurately predict the supernova, meaning they have no idea when the clock is going to chime midnight. Now Admiral Jean-Luc Picard is confident in the righteousness of his cause, and he believes that Starfleet has begun to win over their old enemies, proving that they care for all life. And then Picard's faith is shattered when he's confronted with the reality of the Romulan Empire. He's invited to the hidden colony world of Yuyat Beta, and there learns that the Romulans keep the native population as slaves. It's a horrific revelation, because it means that Yuyat Beta is inhabited by four or five million rather than ten thousand. Worse still, conversation with the Romulan authorities leads to Picard realizing that this slavery is not unusual; which means that, while Starfleet is rescuing the Romulans, then are condemning any number of races to extinction because they are being left behind. Stark Trek Picard Prequel Comic Romulus &quot;I am a fool,&quot; Picard reflects as the issue comes to a close. &quot;So trusting. In the redemption of an old enemy. In my own abilities. In the righteousness of my cause. And now years of hard work, years of struggle against such odds... all for naught.&quot; The story is far from over; the issue ends on a cliffhanger. But it's clear that this is a defining moment in Picard's life, and that his faith in the Federation and its ideals has been shattered once and for all. This might also hint why Jean-Luc Picard ultimately returns to the fray decades later. Star Trek: Picard trailers have confirmed that the Romulan survivors keep Borg prisoners, and it's possible these could be slaves. If so, Picard would object to beings who had been freed from the Collective being taken as slaves, and would no doubt step forward to champion the cause of these ex-Borg. The Romulans' slavery broke him, and their slavery could well be what forces him back into action as well. Star Trek: Picard premieres January 23, 2020 on CBS All-Access and internationally on Amazon Prime Video.

His first experience penning the Dark Knight was way back in 1986 with a Batman Annual short story called The Stalking but his most prominent work and indeed the aforementioned run started in the mid 200s and on this page we’re going to help you figure out the Grant Morrison Batman reading order in it’s simplest form – as collected editions / trade paperbacks, however we will mention what individual issues are included in which book for the die hard collectors out there. Grant Morrison’s Batman doesn’t just stick to the Batman solo series and features some tie-ins from other characters and drifts in and out of Batman &amp; Robin, Detective Comics etc, however this is what trades are made for – to make it easier for readers to get a full story in a single book. For full experience which includes the tie ins this is even more true. Before we begin we’d also want to add that Grant Morrison’s run is not only a decent length but also phenomenally well written and drawn. If you haven’t started on Morrison’s run or just want to get into comics but not sure where to start then here would be a decent choice (not our recommended choice) due to the quality. Grant’s run is also quite famous for having a substantial portion with Dick Grayson as Batman following the events of Final Crisis (which Morrison also wrote). Morrison’s run is deep, engaging and varied- you won’t be bored even after the 40th issue and so on. Some writers become famous for their work on Batman comic books with names like Miller, Loeb, Dixon, Snyder and Morrison is one of them. Click here to skip the full and complete reading order Grant Morrison Batman Trade Paperback Reading Order Contents 1 Grant Morrison Batman Trade Paperback Reading Order 1.1 Pre-Reading – The Black Casebook 1.1.1 What’s included? 1.2 Batman &amp; Son 1.2.1 What’s included? 1.3 The Black Glove 1.3.1 What’s included? 1.4 Batman R.I.P. 1.4.1 What’s included? 1.5 Optional – Last Rites, RIP The Missing Chapter and Final Crisis 1.6 Batman &amp; Robin 1.6.1 What’s included? 1.7 The Return of Bruce Wayne 1.7.1 What’s included? 1.8 Batman: The Return (One shot) 1.9 Batman Incorporated 1.9.1 What’s included? 1.10 Conclusion 2 The Full and Complete Grant Morrison Batman Reading Order Pre-Reading – The Black Casebook The Black Casebook is recommended reading and not officially a part of the Grant Morrison run, however he has clearly used these collections as inspiration as he has provided the forward to the TPB and once you’ve read this and RIP then you will see the connection in front of your very eyes. Grant Morrison’s crazy tales can be steeped in context and The Black Casebook will enable you to understand it all a little bit more. However, as we’ve said previously, TBC is not Grant Morrison’s own work so technically not strictly a part of the reading order but highly recommend to have the true experience. What’s included? If you opt for the trade paperback (recommended) then you will get: Batman #65, 86, 112, 113, 134, 156 and 162, Detective Comics #215, 235, 247 and 267 World’s Finest #89 You’re going to have a hard time finding these individual issues we think so it’s best to get the TPB. Batman: The Black Casebook 47 Reviews Batman: The Black Casebook DC Comics Various (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book Batman &amp; Son Released in September 2006 and ending in December 2006, Batman &amp; Son is where the Grant Morrison’s run begins properly and it doesn’t half begin with a shocker! Batman has a son?! Indeed, and Bruce Wayne’s son with Talia al Ghul is aptly named Damian and a character which is still used a lot today. Damian also features heavily throughout Grant’s trade run too. Batman &amp; Son refers heavily to Batman: Son of the Demon especially the idea of Bruce Wayne having a son, now Grant Morrison has been able to really flesh this out. There are also some other stories included in this trade paperback including a Man-Bat short as well as a Joker segment so it’s not entirely about Batman and his son. Batman &amp; Son not only serves as the start of Grant Morrisons streak but also as one of the most significant storylines in Batman’s entire graphic history. Not to be missed. What’s included? Although you can get a Deluxe Edition which has both this and The Black Glove together, the Batman &amp; Son TPB technically includes: Batman #655-658 Batman 663-666 Sale Batman and Son 138 Reviews Batman and Son Grant Morrison (Author) English (Publication Language) 200 Pages - 07/22/2008 (Publication Date) - DC Comics (Publisher) View Book The Black Glove If Batman &amp; Son is notable for being the beginning of Grant Morrison’s arc proper then The Black Glove is where his run really gets going and becomes the intertwined, labyrinthine masterpiece it is and starts getting closer to RIP and Final Crisis as the critical mass events. The Black Glove explores a secret society before The Court of Owls was even a thing. It’s also notable for introducing Dr. Simon Hurt as well as shining some light on the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne all those years ago. This doesn’t follow What’s included? Getting the Black Glove trade paperback will get you: Batman #667-675 Which means it follows Batman &amp; Son uninterrupted. Get the Deluxe edition if you want both of these two in one book – it’ll probably save you some money, too. Batman: Black Glove 92 Reviews Batman: Black Glove German (Publication Language) Panini Verlags GmbH (Publisher) View Book Batman R.I.P. Next up for the Grant Morrison Batman reading order is R.I.P and this is where it gets tricky and confusing and we wouldn’t really recommend any reader to jump right into here without reading some of Morrison’s previous work and perhaps The Black Casebook. We’ve reviewed RIP as a masterpiece and it’s a supremely well done book that’s thought provoking and quite an iconic book – think Dark Knight Returns, Killing Joke and you’re on the right track. What’s included? Along with the issues that immediately follow The Black Glove you will also get a prologue from DC Universe #0 in the trade paperback Included in the TPB are: Batman #676-683 DC Universe #0 Batman R.I.P. 655 Reviews Batman R.I.P. DC Comics Morrison, Grant (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book Optional – Last Rites, RIP The Missing Chapter and Final Crisis We don’t think that Last Rites, RIP The Missing Chapters and Final Crisis are essential but reading the three of these will definitely enhance the Grant Morrison Batman. Final Crisis was actually written by Grant Morrison anyway. However, what is essential to know is that during Final Crisis Bruce Wayne “dies” and leaves the cowl to Dick Grayson and Damian is his Robin. Sale Final Crisis (New Edition) 829 Reviews Final Crisis (New Edition) DC Comics Morrison, Grant (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book Batman &amp; Robin After the “disappearance” of Bruce Wayne and the events from Battle of the Cowl (not Grant Morrison but is optional, will be discussed in the full and complete reading order) we have Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin in a completely unique dynamic partnership. The 16 issues across the three TPB from Batman &amp; Robin occur in parallel with The Return of Bruce Wayne which is described next – so try and read them simultaneously for the full experience. There is a big revel in Batman Must Die! #15 so make sure to read The Return of Bruce Wayne before this point. Batman &amp; Robin has been written to be enjoyed on it’s own and it’s only towards the end that the series really links to The Black Glove and RIP. We’ve reviewed the entire Grant Morrison Batman &amp; Robin arc and have reviewed them here. Excellent books even on their own. Batman Reborn Review Batman Vs Robin Review Batman Must Die Review What’s included? Pretty simple, the Batman &amp; Robin three trade paperback collection collects; Batman &amp; Robin #1-#16 Batman &amp; Robin, Vol. 1: Batman Reborn (Batman &amp; Robin, 1) 494 Reviews Batman &amp; Robin, Vol. 1: Batman Reborn (Batman &amp; Robin, 1) DC Comics Morrison, Grant (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book Batman &amp; Robin Vol. 2 Batman vs. Robin 201 Reviews Batman &amp; Robin Vol. 2 Batman vs. Robin DC Comics Grant Morrison (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book Batman &amp; Robin, Vol. 3: Batman &amp; Robin Must Die 251 Reviews Batman &amp; Robin, Vol. 3: Batman &amp; Robin Must Die DC Comics Grant Morrison (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book The Return of Bruce Wayne As mentioned in the Batman &amp; Robin section, Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne should be read alongside Batman &amp; Robin. Bruce Wayne is struggling against time following the events of Final Crisis and is doing everything he can to get back to Earth and of course Gotham City. As it involves different periods of time this book is a bit out there and a little but ‘elseworld’ but if you want to read Grant Morrison in full then you can’t skip it! What’s included? Collected in the TPB are the six issues of The Return of Bruce Wayne and that’s it Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #1-6 Sale Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne 312 Reviews Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne DC Comics Morrison, Grant (Author) English (Publication Language) View Book Batman: The Return (One shot) The one shot issue of Batman: The Return is the official return of Bruce Wayne from his trials of time. It may be quite difficult to get a hold of however. Batman: The Return is essentially the first issue of incorporated and explores what’s next in the storyline with the final issue of the Return of Bruce Wayne exploring his return as opposed to his plans. Batman: The Return #1 (One Shot) 2 Reviews Batman: The Return #1 (One Shot) E. C. Publications (Publisher) View Book Batman Incorporated The final set of trade paperbacks are the Batman Incorporated volumes and the Leviathan Strikes! one shot in the middle. Following Batman’s return from being trapped in time he has seen the light and decides that the Bat-family needs to be global and have Batmen all over the world. The reading order is of course, Volume 1, Leviathan Strikes! (included in the new edition of volume 1) and then Volume 2 for the rest. That’s it! You’re now done with Grant Morrison’s Batman in the collected edition format. Within Incorporated spins out a mini story called Requiem for those wanting to explore that more.

Batman: Incorporated #1-16 Batman: Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes! #1 Batman Incorporated Special #1 Conclusion We hope you’ve found this list helpful in finding and knowing how to read Grant Morrison’s epic run. Collecting them as trade and only the parts written by GM himself is the easiest way if you just want to enjoy Grant Morrison’s work. However, if you want to enjoy the story and the expanded Universe surrounding Morrison’s work then the full and complete reading order might be the one for you. The Full and Complete Grant Morrison Batman Reading Order This list is for the full Grant Morrison experience and does included numerous issues of books not written by Grant Morrison but does revolve around his overall storyline and enhances the experience. This collection may be hard to find as it does contain the odd issue and buying a TPB just for that one issue is expensive. However, if you’re on this page this is just the information you’re after, especially if you’re a collector and may want to bind them all yourself for the 100% Grant Morrison Batman book. Bold denotes a tie in.

                   NS1:content="Doctor Who: Top Ten Fifth Doctor Audio Adventures From Big Finish Monday, March 08, 2021 Moo grabs celery and listens up. peter%2Bdavison The Fifth Doctor, played by Peter Davison, is an incarnation that doesn’t seem to get as much attention on audio as many of the others. It makes sense. The Sixth saw the Big Finish audio adventures redeem him, the Seventh had his era cut short so there’s untapped potential being delivered on, and the Eighth never had a TV era in the first place. The Fifth slips under the radar as a result. Although it makes sense, I think it's a shame as some of the Doctor’s best audio-original adventures can be found during his fifth lifetime. So here are ten of my personal recommendations to check out. loups%2Bgaroux 10. Loups-Garoux One of the earliest Big Finish stories is a rare adventure for the Doctor travelling with just Turlough, a dynamic that wasn’t explored much on TV, which should alone make this worth a look. Loups Garoux sees the pair go to Rio De Janeiro and encounter werewolves. It’s a fantastic story, with lots of fun twists and turns along the journey, and gives Peter Davison plenty of excellent material to dive into. This relatively obscure adventure deserves more appreciation. spare%2Bparts%2Bvinyl 9. Spare Parts Because the Fourth Doctor seeing the Daleks’ genesis went so well, it makes perfect sense to send the Fifth to the same for the Cybermen. Almost two decades on from release, Spare Parts still remains one of the most popular Big Finish adventures, even getting a vinyl release (Look at that gorgeous vinyl cover art!), and it’s not hard to see why. Joining the Doctor and Nyssa as they witness a tragedy unfolding and knowing they can’t stop, Spare Parts makes for a compelling bit of drama, one so good that when a Cyberman origin story did show up on TV twice – both three and fifteen years later – each was done carefully to avoid contradicting this one. While it’s been surpassed many times since, the enduring popularity of this story is a testament to just how good it is to have stood the test of time. the%2Belite 8. The Elite There’s a parallel world where The Elite was made for TV, but luckily we still got this audio version of it so we can get a sense of what we missed. The Elite people are one city whose priest watches over their population and controls who gets to live and who is taken away as the other cities can only protest that they weren’t chosen. I won’t spoil it here, but the reveals that come piling on from this set-up and the story that develops from it make for a refreshing experience that feels authentic to 80s Who but also much better than most of that era. If this had been made as presented in this adaptation The Elite would be deservingly heralded as a classic. alien%2Bheart 7. Alien Heart / Dalek Soul One common criticism of the Peter Davison era is how the Doctor is often just along for the ride in his stories. However, in this double-feature we get to see what makes the Fifth incarnation tick. Alien Heart is a fairly bog-standard Dalek adventure but in Dalek Soul the groundwork is built on for an experimental story which makes you question everything you thought you knew about the Fifth Doctor and Nyssa. This was a pleasant surprise when it came out in 2017 and it’s a shame that it slipped under many people’s radar because the result is one of the most compelling Dalek stories of recent years and a terrific character piece for the two leads. peterloo 6. The Peterloo Massacre A rare journey into the “pure historical” genre, The Peterloo Massacre takes place during the titular real life tragedy. It’s good to see a tragic event that not many people know about getting some attention, and this story gives it the honest portrayal such a thing deserves. It’s not an easy listen, with some particularly grim moments that stay with you afterwards, but that makes it all the more important to experience. Peter Davison nails the material with a stunning performance that takes the difficult subject matter and creates a compelling narrative around it. It’s a nasty bit of history but they do it justice, and made this an essential listen as a result. time%2Bin%2Boffice 5. Time in Office It’s amazing how many times in the classic series the Doctor would find himself running as the President of Gallifrey, but for this story we finally get to see it happen. Time in Office plays out like an anthology, as each “episode” focuses on different ideas, but that helps keep it fresh. With such brilliant moments as Leela doing battle with a lawnmower and Tegan becoming Earth’s ambassador to Gallifrey, this release isn’t so interested in all the dramatic potential of the idea as it is in just having fun with them, but because of the actors giving it their all, combined with the strong writing they’re working with, it just works. Seeing Gallifrey played for laughs shouldn’t work as well as this, but it does. Highly recommended. the%2Bsecret%2Bhistory 4. The Secret History This story opens with the Fifth Doctor joined in his TARDIS by First Doctor companions Steven and Vicki, and it plays out exactly like a First Doctor story… So why is the Fifth Doctor in it? That’s the question he sets out to answer along the way, and the answer is every bit as brilliant as you’d hope. I won’t spoil it here, but the choice of villain is a delightful one for fans of the era these companions come from, and it’s a shame that this is their only meeting with this Doctor because they fit so perfectly with him. It’s always a joy to see two very different eras coming together, and The Secret History delivers on the potential of such a set-up. cold%2Bfusion 3. Cold Fusion Cold Fusion originated as a novel but today a copy will set you back several hundred pounds at a minimum, so along come Big Finish to adapt it to audio with the original writer. The multi-Doctor format is used in a unique way, with the earlier Fifth Doctor taking the lead as the Seventh goes more to the sidelines. It’s a marvellous story of science vs superstition, with some delightful Time Lord lore going on in the background making it well worth a look post-Timeless Children. It’s a great showing for the Fifth Doctor, still a new incarnation at this point, as he comes to terms with not just his newest self but also glimpses of a forgotten past and an unknown future. the%2Bkingmaker 2. The Kingmaker The Doctor meets William Shakespeare and King Richard III but neither of them are as you’d expect. This story makes excellent use of the show’s time-travel premise to send the Doctor, his companions, and even many of the supporting cast jumping between different eras as they each figure out what the others have been doing and get themselves caught up in a number of genuine historical mysteries. Also it’s a comedy, with several totally off-the-wall concepts and set-pieces, such as the Doctor being a published author under the name “Doctor Who”. The Kingmaker is insane and can only be done justice by listening to it, which I cannot recommend doing enough. circular%2Btime 1. Circular Time This delightful anthology explores the Doctor’s relationship with his companion Nyssa, with four stories set at various points in her time with him. It’s a character piece for Nyssa primarily, but all four stories are excellent vehicles for that. We have Time Lord intrigue, an encounter with a historical figure, a relaxed time where the Doctor plays cricket, and it concludes with one of the weirdest and most experimental things Big Finish have ever done (and that’s saying something). The resulting anthology stands as a testament to how good they can be, and demonstrates the potential in these characters which the original show often failed to deliver on. Give this one a listen! And they are my choices for top ten Fifth Doctor audio adventures from Big Finish, what are yours? “Moo” is the pseudonym used by this Doctor Who fan. He can usually be found procrastinating by thinking about Doctor Who. Follow him on Twitter @z_p_moo for more of his unusual takes, but do so at your own risk.

                   NS1:content=" Raspberry Pi For home For industry Hardware Software Documentation News Forums Foundation News All news Search the archive RSS Bullseye – the new version of Raspberry Pi OS 8th Nov 2021 Simon Long 350 comments Every two years, Debian Linux, on which Raspberry Pi OS is based, gets a major version upgrade. Debian ‘buster’ has been the basis of Raspberry Pi OS since its release in 2019, and Debian ‘bullseye’ was released in August. (As some of you may know, Debian name their versions after characters in Disney/Pixar’s Toy Story films – Bullseye was Woody’s horse in Toy Story 2.) We’ve been working on the corresponding ‘bullseye’ release of Raspberry Pi OS; it’s taken a bit longer than we’d hoped, but it is now available. So what is new this time? Debian ‘bullseye’ has relatively few major changes which are visible to users – there are some under-the-hood changes to file systems and printing, but most of the changes are patches and upgrades to existing applications and features. However, over and above the changes in Debian itself, the ‘bullseye’ version of Raspberry Pi OS has a number of significant changes to the desktop environment and to the support for Raspberry Pi hardware. GTK+3 All of the desktop components and applications are now using version 3 of the GTK+ user interface toolkit. GTK+ is a layer of software that applications can use to draw standard user interface components (known as “widgets”) such as buttons, menus and the like, so that all applications have a consistent look and feel. Up until now, most of the desktop has used version 2 of the GTK+ toolkit, but increasing numbers of Debian applications are using GTK+3, so to try and keep things consistent, we’ve upgraded all our software and the desktop itself to the newer version. GTK+3 has been around for several years now, and people have occasionally asked why we didn’t move to it before now. The simple answer is that many things are much easier to do with GTK+2 than with GTK+3, particularly when it comes to customising the appearance of widgets – GTK+3 has removed several useful features which we relied upon. It has ended up being necessary to find work-arounds to a lot of these – hopefully no one will notice them and everything will still work as before! You’ll notice a few changes to widgets – the most obvious is the new appearance of tabbed interfaces. Some other controls have a slightly different appearance, but we’ve tried to make sure that everything still looks familiar and largely unchanged. GTK+3 just gives us a more modern basis for future development, and brings us into line with other Linux desktop environments. Window manager One of the changes which was prompted by the move to GTK+3 is that we are using a new window manager, called mutter, instead of the openbox window manager used in previous releases. The window manager is responsible for drawing the title bar and window frame around each application window. Mutter is what is known as a compositing window manager, which means that rather than individually drawing the window frames straight onto the existing windows on screen, it draws all the windows to a memory buffer off screen, where it creates a complete image for the entire screen. This is then sent to the hardware to be displayed. Because it has control of the whole screen, a compositing window manager can create some nice visual effects which are not possible (or at least not easy) with a traditional window manager: for instance, it can round the corners of windows, or display shaded borders behind each window. (While we did have rounded corners in openbox, this was done in a rather inefficient fashion by drawing multiple frames of varying sizes for each window – it worked, but it really wasn’t elegant!) GTK+3 relies on a compositing window manager to round the corners of tooltips; in GTK+2 this was done with a hack similar to the one we use to create rounded window frames in openbox, but this has been removed in GTK+3 and the window manager is asked to do it instead. Mutter gives nice window opening and closing animations, and provides shading behind each window border; the changes are subtle, but they do make the desktop feel more modern. One drawback of mutter is that, due to needing to draw the entire screen to memory before it can display it, it is quite demanding in terms of RAM, and can only run properly on a Raspberry Pi with 2GB or more. As a result, on Raspberry Pis with less than 2GB, the older openbox window manager is still used instead. (This does mean, unfortunately, that on those systems, tooltips will now have square corners. Which is another answer to the question, “so why didn’t you move to GTK+3 years ago…?”) The other advantage of mutter is that it is a necessary step towards the future of Linux desktop environments. Desktops in Linux have always been based on the X Window System, usually just referred to as X. This is what provides the basic services of a window environment – drawing windows, moving them around, managing the mouse pointer and so on. But X is now very old technology – it was first released in 1984 – and while it has served admirably for nearly 40 years, some desktop environments are now using replacements. The most popular of these is a system called Wayland, which has recently become the window system used by Ubuntu. We are still quite a long way from switching Raspberry Pi OS to Wayland, but one of its requirements is a Wayland-compatible compositing window manager, and using mutter is the first step on this path. Notifications One thing that many other operating systems now do is to provide an integrated notification system, whereby messages to the user about the system or applications all appear in a consistent and uniform manner. For this release, we have added a common notification manager to the taskbar, which can be used by the taskbar and any of its plugins, and can also be accessed via other applications. Notifications are shown in windows at the top right corner of the screen, and are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent notifications being presented at the top. Notifications will automatically time out and be hidden after fifteen seconds, or can be cleared immediately by clicking on the windows. The notification timeout can be configured on the Appearance tab of the Panel Preferences dialog, accessed by right-clicking on the taskbar. If the timeout is set to zero, then notifications will remain on display until you click on them. In this dialog, you can also turn notifications off completely – although we wouldn’t recommend doing this! Currently, notifications are generated when USB devices are removed, when the power supply voltage is too low, and when the firmware detects various error conditions, such as memory allocation problems and invalid configuration options. Some of these were already being brought to the user’s attention in previous releases, but this now happens in a more consistent and user-friendly way, with more scope for future extension of the system. Updater plugin Another new feature, which makes use of the notification system, is an easy way to be informed about and to install system and application updates. Up until now, this has required the use of apt in a terminal window, but it has now been brought up to date with a more user-friendly graphical interface, provided as a new plugin in the taskbar at the top of the screen. Every time you boot your Raspberry Pi, the plugin checks to see if any updates are available. (If you leave your Raspberry Pi powered up for days or weeks at a time, don’t worry – it makes additional checks every 24 hours.) If updates are available, then the update icon – the arrow inside a circle in the picture below – is shown on the task bar, and a notification message is shown. Clicking this brings up a menu that allows you either to open a window listing the updates (in case you want to know what they are before you install them…) or just to install them straight away. A dialog box will show you the installation progress of updates, but they will carry on in the background and you can just continue with whatever you are doing while they install. With security threats and vulnerabilities being found and fixed in operating systems on a daily basis, it has never been more important to keep your computer up to date – hopefully this is now as easy on a Raspberry Pi as on any other computer. File manager The view options in the file manager have been simplified slightly for this release. In the previous version, you could select one of four modes – thumbnails, icons, small icons and list. This was a bit of a mess – the differences between thumbnail mode and icon mode were somewhat confusing, as they involved different icon sizes as well as whether or not thumbnails were shown, and the small icon mode was more of a throwback to early versions of Windows than anything actually useful. For this release, there are now only two modes – icons or list. The option to show a thumbnail (if appropriate) for an icon is now in the View menu. The size of icons in either mode can be controlled with Zoom In/Out, also in the View menu. This tidies up the display options, and hopefully does so without removing any useful functionality. KMS video driver The KMS (kernel modesetting) driver, which was an experimental option in previous releases, is now the standard video driver in this release. KMS is the Linux standard mechanism for controlling the connection to a display. The previous video driver was Raspberry Pi-specific, and was built into the custom firmware which is unique to Raspberry Pi computers; it was also closed source. This enabled us to make a number of optimisations for our hardware, but it also meant that any applications that wanted to directly access the display needed to be written specifically for Raspberry Pi. By moving to KMS, any application written using the standard Linux display APIs should run on Raspberry Pi without modification. The other advantage of this approach is that display drivers for Raspberry Pi are now all part of the Linux kernel, and can therefore be written or modified by third parties; previously this code was all in the closed-source firmware. This should make it easier for the manufacturers of items like custom displays to add support for Raspberry Pi. New camera driver The driver used by Raspberry Pi to access camera modules has now been replaced with libcamera, a standard Linux API. As with the video driver change, this means less closed-source proprietary code, and makes it easier for third parties to develop new camera hardware and software. For anyone who has written camera-based applications in the past, this is a very significant change, and is too large to be covered here. There will be a blog post dedicated to the new camera driver published soon, so watch this space! Bookshelf Custom PC magazine, which has recently been made available for free download as PDF files as well as for purchase in print, is now available in the Bookshelf application. Other bits and pieces As is usual with a major upgrade like this, most applications have been upgraded to the latest version; in particular the Chromium web browser is now at version 92, and has been optimised to use the Raspberry Pi hardware to accelerate video playback. We’ve added a bunch more cities to the timezone database used by the startup wizard and the localisation settings page in Raspberry Pi Configuration – some Canadian users were alarmed that Montreal was missing… Please note that when you select a country in the wizard, you will be offered the first city alphabetically as the initial choice of timezone for that country – that’s why Belfast comes up as the timezone for the UK; it’s not a bug! There are various bug fixes, tweaks and new language translations. The details of these can be found in the release notes on the download page. How do I get it? With a major upgrade, we recommend downloading a new image, reinstalling any applications, and moving your data across from your current image. Debian major version upgrades contain a lot of changes, and it is very easy for some small tweak made somewhere in the system to be incompatible with some change you have made, and you can end up with a broken system and a Raspberry Pi that won’t boot. The easiest way to create a new SD card is with the Raspberry Pi Imager tool available here, or you can download the new image from here and use a tool like Etcher to flash it to a new SD card. If you really want to try upgrading an existing image, there are some instructions on the forums here – but we don’t support or recommend this, so be warned: you are on your own if anything breaks! Make a backup of your SD card first so you can always go back to a working system if you need to; the SD Card Copier application in Raspberry Pi OS is a good tool for this. As ever, your feedback on this release is welcome – either add a comment below, or head to our forums.

With the new video and camera drivers does this mean any changes need to be made to the user code, or have the existing user libraries (eg. python modules) been updated to work with the new drivers? Reply to Stewart Watkiss Avatar Harry Hardjono 8th November 2021, 11:15 am That’s a good question. I’m mainly interested in doing video/screen capture and I wonder if the new video modes means I need a different way to do screen capture using ffmpeg to make pi video tutorials. Reply to Harry Hardjono Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 8th November 2021, 11:47 am There are a number of new applications to use the new libcamera API, such as libcamera-vid libcamera-still etc. They are not exactly the same as the raspivid raspicam but they shouldn’t be too difficult to work out. As for libraries, there are of course the libcamera API and you can use the libcamera-app sources to learn more. Check out David’s blog post in the next couple of days talking about the changes there Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar POP 8th November 2021, 2:27 pm It looks like Bullseye’s migration to libcamera completely eliminates support for 2-camera work, including 360° video for virtual reality. Reply to POP Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 8th November 2021, 3:17 pm Currently, dual camera has not been prioritised, but it is being worked on and should be available in time. Exactly how much time is difficult to answer (because it requires upstream changes in libcamera to handle multiple cameras) Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar duck 9th November 2021, 10:51 am Perhaps a good reason to edit the blog to add a clear warning that updating to bullseye likely will break existing code that relies on the old camera libraries?

Reply to Gordon Avatar Al Stevens 8th November 2021, 11:13 am Excellent – but what ironic timing, as we’ve currently just “run out” of spare Pi’s on which to test this! And they’re a little harder to get hold of at the moment. Hopefully we’ll get some more by the end of the week, so I can play around with Pi OS Bullseye….

Thanks for the answer anyway 👍 Reply to Luciano Avatar Charles Godwin 8th November 2021, 12:40 pm Any news on 64bit versions? Please!!! Reply to Charles Godwin Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 1:00 pm Out of interest, why do you want a 64-bit version? The 32-bit version allows individual applications to access up to the 4GB limit, so you can run two applications each with access to 4GB on an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4. The number of applications which actually require (or can use) more than 4GB is tiny – a couple of specialised databases, that’s about it. There may be a few situations where a 64-bit version offers a small performance advantage, but it will be just that – a small advantage. The chances are that a 32-bit version will do everything you want, and it is a tested and reliable solution. If you still really want a 64-bit version, they are available here – https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2021-11-08/ – but we still recommend the 32-bit version for the vast majority of users. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Ben Herrenschmidt 8th November 2021, 1:13 pm Don’t you get twice the registers in the core in 64-bit mode ? That plus registers being wider can bring rather significant improvements on some workloads. Reply to Ben Herrenschmidt Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 1:17 pm In all our testing and benchmarking, 64-bit doesn’t offer any significant speed advantage in the majority of typical use-cases. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Jeff Geerling 8th November 2021, 1:34 pm In nearly every benchmark I’ve run in the same Pi hardware, 64-bit tests are 5-15% faster (for things like transcoding, compressing MP3s, running Python scripts and PHP applications…). Plus if you want to run any Docker/container-based software on the Raspberry Pi (more and more things are easier to deploy this way nowadays), there are an order of magnitude more pre-built images available in an ARM64 variety than armv7. For desktop, general use cases, the differences are minor. And for Pis with 4 GB or less of RAM, the RAM utilization tradeoff might not be worth it, but there are a lot of reasons I prefer running 64-bit Pi OS (even though it’s beta) over the 32-bit version. Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 8th November 2021, 3:21 pm In all my testing of real use-cases (i.e. time something actually happening rather than benchmarks) the 64bit OS is actually the same speed as the 32bit OS. Benchmarks don’t generally transfer very well to real world performance. Even Chromium which shows significant browser benchmark improvements don’t show much improvement in time to render web pages. In fact, if you add the time it takes to start Chromium, render the youtube page and then close Chromium, the 32bit operating system is faster. Gordon Avatar CooliPi 8th November 2021, 6:49 pm I get 10% boost which is very useful for YT video playback in 64bit mode, RPI4 overclocked to 2350MHz. NEON SIMD unit has 2x more registers 2x the width IMO. General purpose registers are 2x the count. Firefox – about 5GB in memory OpenShot – used circa 12GB when exporting ourLiquid Nitrogen video overclok edited entirely on a RPI4. Unusable in 32bit mode. GIMP – can allocate &gt;4GB of memory for large pictures. Freuently used. Any other application which needs memory mapped files. FYI, per process 4GB limit is actually something like 2.3GB limit, some address space needs to be reserved for memory mapped files and kernel. Any application needing lots of memory benefits from 64bit, or crashes in 32bit when it exhausts its 32bit addressing space, and/or fragments its allocated memory. Avatar Mikael Bonnier 8th November 2021, 7:50 pm I now use arm_64bit=1 in /boot/config.txt in Raspberry Pi OS Buster on Raspberry Pi 4 B Rev 1.1 and Rev 1.4 in order to be able to run 64 bit jobs in BOINC: e.g. Rosetta. I also set aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu in cc_config.xml. Is this still the right way to do it in Bullseye? Avatar Esbeeb 8th November 2021, 9:48 pm Simon, you and your team deserve huge kudos for this release (refactoring ALL desktop gui apps to GTK-3? Wow!). I understand how sticking with 32-bit makes support-ability much more approachable for you all. I for one praise that you have taken such great steps to provide a solid distro whatsoever, when virtually all the other SBC makers pale in comparison, when it comes to software support! Thanks for using Debian as your base distro!! I do have a strange 32-bit/64-bit quirk to mention, however. Mattermost Team server (which relies on compiled golang code) has this drastic, show-stopping performance loss in 32-bit, but no loss in 64-bit. It’s night and day. The quirk lies within golang itself (not the Mattermost code, per se), when Mattermost running in 32-bit. 64-bit is your only choice if you want to run Mattermost Team server on a Pi. Avatar Navindra Umanee 20th November 2021, 8:00 am Hey Simon, Thanks for the great update and the link to the 64-bit image! The benefits are massive in at least one real world application. Pianoteq on Raspberry Pi @ https://www.modartt.com/pianoteq gains a significant performance boost on the ARM64 image. I can personally attest to this, as well as several other folks who have tried it: https://forum.modartt.com/viewtopic.php?pid=973230#p973230 http://forum.pianoworld.com/ubbthreads.php/topics/3068923/re-pianoteq-hands-on.html#Post3068923 This is a real and real-time application where the performance benefits of Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit are immediately noticeable and undeniable, in my opinion. Thanks, -N. Avatar Anton 8th November 2021, 1:18 pm For example, I was in need of `__int128_t/__uint128_t`, which is only available on 64-bit system. Just saying… Reply to Anton Avatar Charles Godwin 8th November 2021, 1:51 pm As others mentioned, in many cases I can’t get an arm7 container but arm64 are available. Reply to Charles Godwin Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 1:56 pm Fair enough – in that case, feel free to download an image from the link I posted above. Do bear in mind that the 64-bit images should be regarded as beta software rather than releases; they will almost certainly have issues which are not present in the 32-bit releases. Some tweaks and optimisations haven’t yet been ported to 64-bit, and the 64-bit images are in general less well tested than the official 32-bit releases. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Zolon 8th November 2021, 2:43 pm While it is currently beta, will there ever be a full release of x64?

Onnx runtime is 64bit, PyTorch is 64bit really. I have had it running on 32bit, but new bits break it (Torchvision is a problem). Tensorflow2 is 64bit. Dlib, scikit-learn, tflite runtime work fine on 32bit. Caffe2 (mobilenet) has got enveloped in PyTorch now so that doesn’t work anymore. It is just hard work getting 32bit AI software to install, usually some dependency doesn’t work coz its only available in 64bit.

Reply to Stephen Watt Avatar Joshua 8th November 2021, 8:51 pm Why 64-bit…? Simple. Just note that Jeff Geerling commented…not what he commented, that’s just Midwest American euphemistico-academic-like double speak. What he means to say is: a lot of people would like to attempt some crazy ideas using your products that you might otherwise object to or heavily scrutinize. …BUT! Even worse, it’s clear that at least some crazy ideas do come from insane minds; except, how do you know how crazy of an idea you have exactly? What if you explain your reasoning &amp; it turns out you are indeed quite insane?! That’s a horrifying thought (present your idea &amp; discover you’ve lost your mind! Yikes!). So I wouldn’t exclude some degree of neuroticism as part explanation as to why… Hence, Jeff with his razzle dazzle, &amp; all these other people with incomplete or vague reasons; that’s the reason why the level of demand for the impractical 64-bit OS continually draws your interest for a rationale but never satisfies. So, why 64-bit?—Probably for all sorts of crazy ideas from users that: 1. want to try some ~crazy stuff out w/o revealing their true level of skill &amp;/or w/o being scrutinized; or, 2. want to try out some really crazy stuff w/o being scrutinized &amp; who don’t want to be discouraged &amp; who are deeply neurotic, fearing they might be insane but are not; or, 3. want to try out some extraordinarily crazy, borderline incoherent stuff who don’t want to be scrutinized &amp; who are deeply neurotic, fearing they might be insane b/c they are indeed completely out of their minds &amp; absolutely are insane. Or, at least, that’s my theory as to why…(?). Reply to Joshua Avatar freq 10th November 2021, 11:13 pm So, without trying to appease the courts.. If a chip is capable of a more recent standard, it can be taken advantage of. I have not found any proof of a 64 bit OS would degrade performance. Let’s admit that the reason we don’t have 8gb of ram in the 400 is because it would bring the project over budget. Running 64 bit could benefit some people and would not harm anyone who didn’t need the added benefit. Reply to freq Avatar Russell 9th November 2021, 12:46 am IIRC LibreOffice has quit development on 32-bit. So 64-bit Libreoffice apps are likely going to keep compatibility better with those in the Microsoft Office world. I know I have experienced issues with password protected files, as well as other features. Reply to Russell Avatar Nick 10th November 2021, 6:06 pm LibreOffice 6.2 is indeed the last 32-bit build offered *directly* by The Document Foundation, but Debian has i386 (32-bit) packages even for LibreOffice 7.x. 7.0 is the default version in Bullseye and 7.2 is available in the “backports” Reply to Nick Avatar Jake 9th November 2021, 3:37 am MongoDB as of version 3.2 does not support 32-bit ARM at all, that’s a big one right there. You can in theory do hacks to workaround and compile it on 32 bit but you end up with a lot of the 3.2+ features stripped out when you do that (the backend used in 3.2+ just won’t work on 32 bit arm) that’s a big one for me. Reply to Jake Avatar Anders 9th November 2021, 6:45 pm PostgreSQL 14 on ARM 64 bit only. Reply to Anders Avatar Luke 9th November 2021, 11:19 pm There’s a bunch of software out there that is either dropping support for 32-bit arm, or doesn’t have any at all. I’m surprised and a little bit alarmed that you’re surprised by this. Reply to Luke Avatar Mark Tomlin 10th November 2021, 1:14 am For myself, I use the 64bit version of Raspberry Pi OS because there is no 32bit version of Deno (https://deno.land) and it will not compile on 32 bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS as it’s not a supported triple target (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu) There is also no tier 1 support for 32bit arm triple targets for rust (https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html). Reply to Mark Tomlin Avatar Edgar Vonk 10th November 2021, 8:57 am We would very much like a default (recommended) 64 bit version of Raspberry Pi OS because we want to run software on the Pi that only supports 64 bit OSes (e.g. InfluxDB 2). Sure, we can tell our users to install the (less supported) 64 bit OS but we want to stick with the ‘official’ default Raspberry OS as much as possible.

Reply to Ron Wheeler Avatar Ben Sandland 11th November 2021, 7:50 am On the flip, and out of curiosity, why would you want 32-bit when there’s 64-bit?

Reply to Ben Sandland Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 11th November 2021, 2:28 pm Because we want to maintain support for every model of Raspberry Pi back to the original Pi 1 for as long as is practical – the earlier Raspberry Pis have processors which will not run a 64-bit OS. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Hatim 12th November 2021, 2:52 pm That is indeed the right thing to do. But some time in the future, non 64 bit pis need to be retired. But for that to happen the sale of non 64 bit pis will have to be discontinued and people given some grace period. So 2030? :). I hope 64 bit comes out as stable soon. Avatar Jack Ward 26th November 2021, 11:06 am Why 64 bit for me? (1) because it is there (2) because as a system integrator, I’ve been building real world servers with 64 bit Linux OSes for close to 20 years. (Ok I’m an old guy too. ) (3) because I believe in moving to the future, not sticking to the past. My opinion? Freeze 32 bit development and concentrate on the future. Avatar Wesley R Handrow 12th November 2021, 11:53 am Astap for plate solving when using the pi for astro-imaging kinda requires 64bit. The database used is quite large. Reply to Wesley R Handrow Avatar Steven Sokol 12th November 2021, 1:03 pm It’s not the 64 bit nature of the OS that’s critical, it’s that there are packages that are only available for arm64. In my case, I need to run the Delve debugger for Go which is not available (and won’t be available) for arm7. Reply to Steven Sokol Avatar Maciek S 12th November 2021, 5:56 pm Not a “small amount”, but for example some of us use this to run Java applications and services for tests like Kafka or Spark. Spark uses quite a lot of RAM. That is experimentation with clusters (I have several RPi’s for that). If we have 8GB we should be using it especially that Java 17 is capable VM that may be more interesting than Python for last years for bulk processing data (consider Scala). You missed the point that developers using RPi with IntelliJ will need more memory. I made this thing work remotely to bank (job) for fun with Cisco Workspace and required security, but we may want to use community versions of tools for professional work. None of current IDE’s offered on RPi from standard repos are even close to what is used in commercial use (we can get them from commercial vendors for RPi) and so, people cannot learn tools and methods that are later relevant if they take a job. So education purpose is limited if you do not go to 64-bit. Reply to Maciek S Avatar Ralph-Rainer Schütz 13th November 2021, 12:13 pm Thanks for the update of the 64-bit version. Many reasons why a official 64-bit version is desirable have been posted already. Another example would be that 32-bit php only supports a very restricted range of dates, while your free for human history in the 64-bit version. I suspect that 32-bit version will increasingly get problems in subtle ways. Yesterday I compared a (inofficial) launcher for Minecraft Bedrock edition. The Google Playstore-login based authentication for this to work failed in the 32-bit OS while it worked on the 64-bit release. While it’s hard to tell on which level the failure occurs, it does seem to have to do with Chromium, possibly differences in the Chromium versions? Reply to Ralph-Rainer Schütz Avatar Jack Williams 14th November 2021, 11:29 am Simon, I saw your note asking “out of interest, why do you want it?”. I’ve got to return that question, been running 64 bit for awhile and I’m pretty happy with it but? You make a good point, nonetheless, however, I have to ask you, out of interest, it’s a 64 bit chip, why wouldn’t you, and the foundation, want to convert the OS to 64 bit? What’s holding back from stepping completely away from 32 bit and moving forward with what the platform is capable of? Reply to Jack Williams Avatar Ravi Joshi 15th November 2021, 5:59 pm I need 64 bit version – once I usually (have to ) build myself – such as linux containers.

Reply to JONATHON WISNOSKI Avatar Robert Plantz 2nd December 2021, 7:45 pm I’m rewriting a book that includes an introduction to ARM assembly language using a Raspberry Pi. The current version is 32-bit (bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/intro-co-rpi.html). But I think that 64-bit ARM is a much nicer instruction set architecture for teaching, especially since students are more likely to encounter 64-bit than 32-bit in the future. For example, Apple’s M1 uses 64-bit. I’m running 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS beta on my 3B. So far, my very simple C/C++ and assembler programs for the book are compiling/assemblying just fine. I’m using the 3B as a sort of “stress test” to see the minimum system that a student could use for my book. The only problem I’m having with the 3B is that mutter apparently won’t run, but the package manager doesn’t recognize that, so gives me an error when I try to upgrade.

Whether those will perform well enough is down to the device on which the OS is being run. So yes, you can run Bullseye on the Pi1, Pi0 etc. The system will auto detect the system, and will turn off RAM intensive desktop features to ensure it works on lower end devices, but you cannot expect the same level of performance as on the more powerful Pi’s in the range. Reply to jamesh Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 8th November 2021, 3:26 pm We’ve done a fair amount of extra work to make sure the performance on Pi 1 is as good as it can be. That’s not to say that it is as good as Jessie, because that had far more Raspberry Pi specific hacks to help its performance.

Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 4:33 pm 2), clearly – Debian requires more system resource with every major release, like pretty much every other piece of software ever written.

Other themes are not likely to work correctly, particularly with the change to GTK+3 in this release. That said, lxappearance is working fine for me on the new image, and changing theme does work if I try it. It is possible that something in your specific configuration is causing problems with lxappearance under buster.

Support may be added in future, but that’s not a promise of anything, and I couldn’t say when it might happen if it does – sorry! Reply to Simon Long Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 5:14 pm Sorry – having just double-checked this, I was wrong. It isn’t the KMS drivers which don’t support rotation; it is the mutter window manager; if you try and load a configuration with rotation, it ignores it. We’ll have a look and see if it is possible to get it working in future. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 5:43 pm And further, having just fiddled with it, it was actually a problem in the Screen Configuration app which was getting the mutter configuration slightly wrong for rotated screens. I’ve just fixed it – there will be a fix in apt in the next day or so.

Reply to yan Avatar Andrew Oakley 8th November 2021, 3:06 pm Where can I find the official lifecycles for Raspberry Pi OS releases, please? When will Jessie, Stretch and Buster stop receiving security updates? Stop receiving application updates? Stop receiving backports (if any)? Where can I read this on an official web page, please? I have literally only just finished re-doing Cotswold Jam’s basic Raspberry Pi OS image from Stretch to Buster so that it can work on the Pi Zero 2 (we couldn’t afford Pi 4s so that wasn’t an issue). Now apparently that work was a waste of time and I’ve got to start from scratch all over again. This is made considerably worse because there is no upgrade path from previous versions. I have to throw away my card images and start again from a standard release. This is not a reasonable way for the world’s best-selling computer ecosystem to operate after nearly ten years in production. We need long-term supported releases and we need an upgrade path (even if it’s only for the “lite” / server release). I appreciate this isn’t what you want to hear, but it’s the truth. Reply to Andrew Oakley Liz Upton Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 8th November 2021, 3:13 pm AFAIK we follow whatever Debian’s policy is. Peter Green, who is the maintainer of the Raspbian project, is extremely assiduous about updates. Reply to Liz Upton Avatar Peter Green 8th November 2021, 8:54 pm The Raspbian project will continue importing and attempting to build updates from Debian for as long as Debian produce those updates. Contrary to what some other posters have said this *DOES* include LTS updates. It *DOES NOT* include ELTS updates as those are not distributed through the official debian infrastructure. However note that some important packages, particularly the kernel are supplied by Raspberry Pi, not by the Raspbian project. Historically these have not been updated for previous releases once a new release is made. I do not have any control over such updates. Also some updates may get held up by problems, I cannot guarantee any particular level of effort being put into these problems, particularly for older releases or for less well-known packages. Firefox/Thunderbird in particular are a PITA to keep updated and stopped getting updates on raspbian stretch some time ago, how supported they will be on buster and bullseye remains to be seen. I would advise anyone running a system in a high-risk environment to follow Debian security alerts and act accordingly. Reply to Peter Green Liz Upton Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 8th November 2021, 10:00 pm Thanks for the confirmation, Peter – and thank you for all you do. Reply to Liz Upton Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 8th November 2021, 3:30 pm We are looking at providing long term updates (at least while Debian supply them) for Buster. But currently we’re still discussing how this will work and how we will test and release them. Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Andrew Oakley 8th November 2021, 3:41 pm Thanks for the replies. I really do appreciate that this is an uncomfortable question for the RPi team, so thanks for the honesty and partial answers. However, with RPis increasingly being used in long-term environments – not just in education, but for example I use RPis with Raspberry Pi OS Lite in my day-job for industrial processes – long-term support and upgrade paths are going to be an increasing issue. For example, if you’re using a CM3 module in a display system, that should be expected to have a 7-15 year life span. Railway stations do not throw away their departure boards every two years. Similarly, my shall-remain-nameless household-name industrial customer is not going to want to physically swap SD cards, or God forbid actual hardware, from the bowels of their robotic production line every other year. These are growing pains. They are GOOD problems to have. They indicate that the Pi has moved on from plaything and educational accessory, to doing proper jobs that people rely on for years or decades. But that means that the update cycle for the OS has got to move with it. Repeat after me: It’s a GOOD problem to have. But you still have to solve it. Reply to Andrew Oakley Avatar jamesh 8th November 2021, 4:09 pm Not uncomfortable at all. We sell a LOT of devices in to industry so are very aware of industrial requirements, hence the discussions internally on how best to support industrial and commercial customers. We even have a relatively new team whose almost sole purpose is to help these customers.

Reply to Nick Hebdon Avatar Peter Vincent 8th November 2021, 3:34 pm Running headless on RPi4 is terrible unless i have a real HDMI monitor attached. It might be connected with only being able to set resolution on HDMI ports in this release? VNC comes up but with a default resolution on which the screen doesn’t properly fit and all mouse movements and command lag terribly. I can’t see anyway specifying what resolution the pi should be using (used to be possible with raspi-config but that option is no longer there). Sorry if I am being dozy! Reply to Peter Vincent Avatar Dr Paul Kuczora 8th November 2021, 4:17 pm Just spend a couple of quid on a “dummy HDMI” plug to fool the system into thinking that a monitor is connected.

Reply to Simon Long Avatar Sanjib Acharya 25th December 2021, 4:23 pm I faced the same issue with RealVNC. I had loaded Buster 10 on my RPi 4B before and RealVNC was working to my satisfaction. After I moved to Bullseye, I am practically not able to use realVNC because of the lag. Has anyone tried working with Vscode? Same lag issue or better? With Buster, I was able to work with Vscode with ease. Have not tried after I have loaded Bullseye. Reply to Sanjib Acharya Avatar Ed 9th November 2021, 10:41 am Yeah, same: VNC is unusable with 5 second lag on the mouse. Also, Screen Layout Editor doesn’t recognise the screen despite “hdmi_force_hotplug=1” in config.txt, so the display is stuck on 1024×768 which is too small for some system windows. Also, probably unrelated: the menu bar overlaps the desktop (i.e. top of the rubbish bin is hidden). I really think the VNC workflow should be added to the testing requirements! I can’t be the only one that mainly uses VNC to see the desktop of their RPi’s. Reply to Ed Avatar Peter Vincent 10th November 2021, 7:26 pm Updates today appear to have fixed this as I can now set a headless resolution with raspi-config for VNC to use when running headless. Thanks. Reply to Peter Vincent Avatar Norman J Jackson 8th November 2021, 3:51 pm Looks good so far – very slick. The only glitch I have found is that some of the panel widgets have issues. The desktop pager installs but when you select another page, you get an orange screen (of death). I guess that is teething problems with switching to mutter. Maybe it is just me that finds paging between screens the best thing since sliced bread. Reply to Norman J Jackson Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 4:37 pm We’ve never supported desktop paging; it’s in there because it’s in LXDE, and we’ve never actually removed it, but it’s not something we will be supporting going forward, I’m afraid. If it doesn’t work with mutter – and it sounds as if it doesn’t – we are unlikely to have the time to fix it. If someone else wants to submit a relevant patch, we’ll happily take a look at it. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Norman J Jackson 9th November 2021, 8:11 am OK – after some thought about compositing, the pager would need to work in a much different way, and use a lot of memory as well. Probably not surprising that it doesn’t work – although it does make an interesting mess of the screen! Reply to Norman J Jackson Avatar PeterO 9th November 2021, 11:48 am Look like I’ll not be using PI’s for much longer then. This is a show stopper for me. Do you ever actually think of the impacts on users of the dogmatic decisions you make ? Reply to PeterO Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 12:21 pm Peter, you are fully aware of how small the software team at RPi is. The only person who is actively supporting LXDE – not just at Pi, but anywhere – is me. I have been full time on this release for 9 months, getting a huge amount of code ported to GTK+3 (something you have complained about the lack of in the past) and getting a completely new window manager working as part of a future migration path, along with all the other porting and migration required for a Debian major version upgrade. It is simply not possible for us to support every single feature that LXDE had when we started working with it. The number of people who use paged desktops is tiny, and I have been very clear for several years that this is not a feature we support. We (I) can’t do everything, and it makes sense to prioritise the features which are commonly used rather than the ones which are used by relatively few people. If you want to work out why paging is broken, I will be happy to take a patch for it, but it’s simply not something we have the capacity to support going forwards. If you really need paged desktops, then I suggest you switch to an OS which does still support them such as Ubuntu. Reply to Simon Long Avatar CJ 14th November 2021, 4:28 pm Simon, I’ve been where you are. The only one person supporting an entire software infrastructure. In the past I asked for a backup citing “what if I get hit by a bus” company didn’t seem to care until I got a great job offer from another company. After 15 years my employer couldn’t understand why I was leaving. I had enough. It wasn’t the money either. It was the mundane working environment and lack of a future for me. The Pi organization should really get you an apprentice or backup. Avatar Norman J Jackson 20th November 2021, 9:48 am After an update I tried the desktop pager again, as I am an optimist. mirabile dictu now the pages are there in all their glory! One explanation would be that the software elves came and fixed them. The more attractive explanation is that we live in a simulation and the the simulation decided it would be easier to patch our universe so it didn’t have to synthesize all the complaints about paging not working. Avatar Eli Hatamov 8th November 2021, 3:57 pm The best news about this release is the upcoming Wayland support :) I’m waiting for it since I’ve seen this demo: https://youtu.be/n4oDvEuwgbA Reply to Eli Hatamov Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 8th November 2021, 4:38 pm As I said in the post, Wayland is a long way off, and it may never happen.

On the post you mentioned that there’s open box WM on the 1 gig pi variants and mutter for the rest, the question is why not implenting GNOME with Wayland support to the 2 gig and up pis ? You could do it on the matter of weeks probably Reply to Eli Hatamov Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 1:37 pm For a start, the GNOME desktop experience is completely different from LXDE, and we like our customised LXDE better than GNOME! So we will not be moving to a GNOME-based desktop purely to enable Wayland on some platforms; that makes no sense.

Seeing this post, I transferred some files to a usb, shutdown my pi, removed the sd card, put it into a micro-sd to usb converter and pluged the converter into my mac. I then installed Raspberry Pi Imager. I first wrote Erase onto my sd card. Then I wrote Raspian Full. I removed the sd, put it back into my pi and booted it up. The boot was normal, but right when it should have opend the desktop, my monitor (Lenovo) shutdown. I could tell the boot had worked because Orca Screen Reader was on. Using Orca a a guide I shutdown the Pi and tried it a few more times. No luck. I don’t know what to do. Any tips? Reply to Andrew Avatar W. H. Heydt 8th November 2021, 5:44 pm Congrats on getting Bullseye “out the door”. As for mutter vs. openbox on older (i.e. &lt; 2GB) Pis…works for me as I'm not enamored of rounded corners. Square is just fine by me. Clearly, the handwriting is on the wall…the future of Pis won't include 1GB Pi2s or Pi3s. So unless my long term wish comes true (not counting on it), one of my major–if intermittent–uses will have to migrate to Pi4s (or later)…but only after the temporary price hike goes off. Reply to W.

Will this image use openbox on a Pi4 B 2GB or will need to configure Mutter as well? Reply to Milliways Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 9:30 am Mutter will be used by default whenever the imaage is run on a platform with 2GB or more, so moving a card between a Pi 3 and a Pi 4 will switch from openbox to mutter. The screen resolution settings made in the Screen Configuration tool should be for both window managers, so the resolution should be correct on both.

Reply to Kevin Moore Avatar MW 9th November 2021, 3:29 am On a positive note it is good that Bullseye ARM32 release has finally been offered. On a negative note it seems depending on model of RPi we have differences, which will lead to confusion. I personally believe that the RPi 4B / 400 / CM4 should only of been offered with a RaspiOS (Debian ARM64) ARM64 Operating System. Whilst all previous models should of continued with the Raspbian based ARM32 RaspiOS, making this release 5+ year Long Term Support. ( I also disagree with the 64bit Kernel Option what a waste of resources ) This has been a missed opportunity in fully realising the potential of the BCM2711 models and shedding the insane need for backward compatibility. It is not likely that RPT could not afford to employ 2 operating software teams, after a decade I am disappointed with the OS choices and that includes the x86 “look-a-like” which is dreadful compared to other Debian based x86-32 OSes.. This situation Reply to MW Avatar MW 9th November 2021, 4:22 am This situation has left me seriously disappointed and will hold of purchasing a BCM2711 model, and will wait for the next Raspberry Pi SBC which out of the box supports a stable ARM64 release. Reply to MW Avatar James Hughes 9th November 2021, 7:57 am Getting the 32bit bullseye out, with all the multitude of changes was a lot of effort, 9 months in fact. But that effort is also applicable to the 64bit version, and we released a new beta yesterday as well. We can now concentrate on fixing bugs and testing that. We are happy that this process is the fastest route to getting both 32 and 64 bit versions. And no, a bigger team was not an option.

Thanks for all your efforts. When the 64 bit version is out I plan on updating all my pi4’s to it. I do have a question. Even though the pi3B+ is only 1 gig of memory will the 64bit of Bullseye be any faster? I ask this and also will it help the new Pi 2 zero? I have noticed that Zram has greatly improved my Pi 2 zeros. It even shows the swap has more than doubled up to 1.65gb. if I plan on swapping cards with 64 bit applications from Pi’s like 3B+ and 2 zero I’m hoping that I can just swap cards and not worry that I have to have multiple images for different pi models as long as they do support 64 bit. Also will there be any noticable improvement in speed or anything for a pi 2 zero running 64 bit(zram installed) from the 32 bit version? Same question for any pi model that runs 64 bit but is under 4gig memory!

Reply to MW Avatar Pau 9th November 2021, 5:12 pm I’d like to know also if video acceleration is available in the 64bits version Reply to Pau Avatar pbr6891 9th November 2021, 9:54 am are there any restriction with bullseye regarding chromium on Pi 0 W ? it wont start / keeps crashing …. this is on a fresh install of bullseye on a pi0 w with all the latest updates installed (through the auto updater) …. I have tried with different SD cards and different Pi 0 W same results … wont start / keeps crashing Reply to pbr6891 Avatar Ziad Khattab 9th November 2021, 10:06 am Hi Guys, Just wondered if any of you have come across this yet. I upgraded to Bullseye last night using Raspberry Pi imager on Windows and a new SD card. All was great until I started playing videos on VLC player. It worked fine for a while but suddenly the sound from my Pi 400 vanished! It has no sound now. Not on VLC or Youtube or anything. It won’t make a sound now. It’s like the sound driver or something has vanished. I am a Pi newbie although I have good experience on computers dating right back to the ZX Spectrum. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Note I’ve now re-inserted my previous SD card with the older Rasberry Pi OS and the sound was there. So I presume it’s a software issue. Thanks in advance. You guys are great. Reply to Ziad Khattab Avatar beta-tester 9th November 2021, 10:24 am i tried the new RaspiOS Bullseye (“Normal” and Full) images on my RPi3B and RPi4B and there it seems Firefox-ESR has its sound back again :D so it has been more a problem of how PulseAudio was integrated in Raspberry Pi OS Buster… so no Firefox specific sound problem as it has been claimed again and again (at least for this specific issue). Reply to beta-tester Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 10:44 am We’ve made no changes at all to pulseaudio for the bullseye release – the config is exactly the same as on buster. So if it now works, it was an upstream problem which has been fixed in the bullseye versions of pulseaudio or Firefox. As I think I may have claimed again and again… ;) Reply to Simon Long Avatar beta-tester 9th November 2021, 12:54 pm anyhow i am very happy to have sound in firefox-esr back again. thank you for the RaspiOS Bullseye! Reply to beta-tester Avatar Max 9th November 2021, 11:52 am After installing BullsEye I can choose only jack for audio (clicking with right button on sound icon, I have lost HDMI choose) Reply to Max Avatar Mathieu Schopfer 19th November 2021, 4:12 pm Hello, I experienced the same issue. I commented out the following line in `/boot/config.txt` and sound came back over HDMI, but was lost over jack: &gt; dtparam=audio=on I haven’t found a solution yet to enable both HDMI and jack outputs. Reply to Mathieu Schopfer Avatar Michael 9th November 2021, 12:50 pm Where has the resolution setting gone? I use all my Pi’s headless with VNC and usually with 1024×768 resolution. This is normally set from display in preferences but the command is gone from there and from raspi-config. Reply to Michael Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 1:16 pm The resolution setting option has been removed from Raspberry Pi Configuration and raspi-config because the method used for that setting doesn’t work with the new KMS driver – you need to use the Screen Configuration tool to set resolutions. However, it looks as if settings made in there are ignored if the monitor is disconnected – we’ll look into that. Reply to Simon Long Avatar beta-tester 9th November 2021, 1:00 pm “Screen Configuration” tool on my RPi4B(4GB)+4kTV seems to not doing its job. i am not possible to change the secreen resolution. the tool shows teh new resolution in the list after apply&amp;reboot, but the real screen resolution is still at 4096×3160. i have to disable # dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d to change the screen resolution with Raspberry Pi Configuration.

I did a quick install on RPi4 , it looks good and fluid. I’m just stressing concerning the camera interface, I’m not able to run a simple picamera hello world code in python. I suppose it has to do with the new libcamera support, where could I find more info about that ? I will have potentially a lot of code to be updated … I’ll do gladly the beta-tester thanks in advance for your feedback Reply to Al Aeluvidu Avatar AndrewS 10th November 2021, 1:06 pm Lots of libcamera documentation here: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html Reply to AndrewS Avatar Peter Vincent 9th November 2021, 3:08 pm As a side-effect of needing to have a monitor attached for VNC to work properly, which hopefully will be fixed quite soon, I noticed that I was not getting any sound on the monitor which is HDMI. I rebooted using an SD card of previous version without any customisation and the sound over HDMI works fine there. Tried messing with HDMI settings in config.txt but no joy. Reply to Peter Vincent Avatar Supra 9th November 2021, 3:43 pm Doesn’t Bullseye work with 4K monitor? Reply to Supra Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 3:55 pm Yes, it has been extensively tested with 4K monitors – I have been using it with one for months! Reply to Simon Long Avatar Esbeeb 9th November 2021, 4:53 pm 9 months of hard work on all the LXDE changes? Please people, don’t complain, but rather show some sort of gratitude, and perhaps offer to take Simon out for lunch or something (complete with his favourite beverage) if you live within range of him! He did an outstanding job for just one person. It’s an achievement for the Linux world, that LXDE was brought forward into the far-more-modern GTK-3 widget set. **People might be far more willing to write GUI apps for the Raspberry Pi OS desktop, knowing that!** This change opens the door, people. Reply to Esbeeb Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 5:21 pm Bless you! (The cheque is in the post… ;) In all seriousness, thank you so much for this comment – it’s really good to know that things that are perhaps not immediately obvious to the user are appreciated; it does make all the work worthwhile. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Esbeeb 9th November 2021, 5:38 pm Thanks Simon, for your acknowledgement. I used to be a Linux Sysadmin for various software corporations for like 6 years, so I am a master of understanding the non-appreciation that end users can quite easily have (let alone complaining), even when one is gruellingly moving small mountains around, as it were, behind the scenes. ;) Reply to Esbeeb Avatar Lucy 9th November 2021, 5:49 pm Hi, thanks for your hard work. I am also having trouble with the Screen Configuration tool. Also on a 4k television (brand LG). But even after the reboot I am still on 4k resolution even though the tool does remember I set it lower. If it helps : on Buster with this TV the tool works when NOT booting into the command line. If I start the GUI with startx it has similar behaviour of auto-switching to 4k, so it always had slight issues anyhow. Reply to Lucy Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 6:09 pm This is a known bug which I am working on at the moment – it seems that some displays are not reporting their serial number in a format which can be recognised by the window manager, and as a result the custom resolutions get rejected. I’m not sure how long it will take me to fix, but I’d hope it won’t be more than a day or two. Reply to Simon Long Avatar sparkyhall 9th November 2021, 8:14 pm I am unable to set 30Hz refresh rate from the Screen Configuration tool. It appears as an option, I select and reboot when prompted. After the reboot my Monitor (Dell U3419W) still says 60Hz even though the Screen Configuration tool shows 29.97Hz. I use 30Hz so that I can connect through a 4 port KVM at a higher resolution. Reply to sparkyhall Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 9th November 2021, 8:31 pm That is probably another effect of the same bug affecting monitors with a particular serial number format which I have just fixed. There will be an update in apt in the next day or so which should fix it. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Lucy 13th November 2021, 7:25 pm Just reporting back that not only is it now working, it is even working better than it ever did in Buster when starting the GUI from the command line (startx). Thank you. Reply to Lucy Avatar Supra 10th November 2021, 12:45 pm @Lucy. Mine is working. I’m using Samsung 55inch curve tv. I do not used Screen Configuration tool. So basically, I set to font size to 18 from tv setting not RPi4.Leave that RPi 4 alone.

It works when hardwired but not on WIFI. Reply to MIke Avatar Jack 10th November 2021, 3:00 am Huge thanks for all your work Simon and the Pi team! Im relatively new to the Pi and loving it. I have a small issue with the update but looking through the comments it looks like it has been reported. Ive got a Pi4 in a Mac classic case. The LCD that i put in is a lot bigger then the crt it replace so i have to fix the underscan and change the res. My issue is in the screen configuration app, After a restart from changing from 1:8 to 1:4 view or changing the screen res it defaults back to 1:8 and 1200 by something. Looks like its probably the same issue others are having but I was told to report it anyway. Keep up the great work!!!

Reply to jamesh Avatar Fred Bauer 11th November 2021, 4:56 pm Sigh, so no Bullseye for me as I’m not going to spend time rewriting code that depends on it. Would have been nice to have what’s been removed highlighted in the article, it would have saved me several hours of trying it. Reply to Fred Bauer Avatar Gabriel Florit Polanco 10th November 2021, 5:22 am 1st of all, I have to thank u all for your amazing work on this release, it runs much better than Buster on my Pi4 and 3B+. But i have to agree with the comments above about the need for a stable, fully working, release of an ARM64 version of Bullseye. It would certainly improve the experience and make the Pi even more usable than already is. Some software packages are only available for ARM64, and others, while working on ARM32, can take advantage of a 64bit OS. Reply to Gabriel Florit Polanco Avatar jamesh 10th November 2021, 9:35 am We released a new beta on the same day Bullseye was released. It needs testing, but is close to feature complete. In actual fact, it provides very little increase in performance for general desktop tasks, so no real increase in usability. Reply to jamesh Avatar Dmitriy Dmitrenok 10th November 2021, 7:19 am Hello. After switching to Bullyes, there were some problems with VNC. There was no problem before. When connecting my smartphone as a remote desktop, there was a huge delay in control. Any pressing occurs with a delay of 5-6 seconds. What could be the problem and what ways are there to fix it? Reply to Dmitriy Dmitrenok Eben Upton Raspberry Pi Staff Eben Upton 10th November 2021, 7:43 am We don’t fully understand the issue yet, but we are working on an interim fix at the moment. Reply to Eben Upton Avatar Masoud 10th November 2021, 8:07 am Go to /boot/config.txt and comment out this lines and reboot. dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d max_framebuffers=2 Reply to Masoud Avatar Peter Vincent 10th November 2021, 11:56 am I tried that but then VNC only gives a stamp-sized screen saying it can’t display a desktop. Adding resolution info to config.txt made no difference, but when I reconnected a monitor and rebooted that doesn’t come on either. So have put things back to see if an update to VNC sorts it. Reply to Peter Vincent Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 10th November 2021, 4:14 pm We’ve just pushed a bunch of updates which will hopefully help with this – if you update your Pi, you will now have an option on the Display tab of Raspberry Pi Configuration to set the resolution for the remote desktop. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Pau Aliagas 10th November 2021, 8:29 am Does the x86_64 version support hardware acceleration in VLC, ffmpeg and Chromium?

Reply to Pau Aliagas Avatar nikhimwarrier 10th November 2021, 9:18 am I was wondering how is the performance of this new release vs the previous one on lower-end Pi’s? Specifically the Pi Zero 2? Reply to nikhimwarrier Avatar Ludwig Eksteen 10th November 2021, 10:10 am I’ve installed the new Version of Raspberry Pi OS onto a new flash drive, inserted it into my Raspi 4b and everything worked great. I completed the setup and updated everything during the initial setup guide. I tried to play a YouTube video but it never actually starts playing even if it buffers 3 minutes of video. So I decided to restart my Pi and it doesn’t go back into the OS again. I’ve since went through the entire process again and once again after restarting, it gives me a blank screen and doesn’t go into the OS at all. Why would this be? Reply to Ludwig Eksteen Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 10th November 2021, 11:53 am It sounds as if something has corrupted your SD card somehow – I’d suggest re-flashing it and trying again. Reply to Simon Long Avatar HPCguy 12th November 2021, 3:27 am FYI — I saw similar *behavior* due to the EEPROM being updated incorrectly, though I can’t guarantee what you are seeing is for the same reason. Here was my issue, which they fixed in Buster: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=1917025#p1917025 Reply to HPCguy Avatar Jon W 10th November 2021, 11:24 am I have just installed Bullseye and so far am very impressed; congratulations on all the hard work involved! I installed Blender (as we use this in school on our lab of RPi) and was pleased to see version 2.8 being installed; however it does not work as the graphics does not support OpenGL 3.3 :-/ Is there any way to get the version of Blender that was available in Buster installed on Bullseye? I am assuming that there is no way round the OpenGL requirement from Blender on version 2.8… Reply to Jon W Avatar Martin 10th November 2021, 12:01 pm Hi in the video, you say a ‘fresh’ install is better than an upgrade. Is there a way to list all the current s/w and convert it to an install script, so the new install will have the same progs and settings?? Thanks loads Reply to Martin Avatar Bruce Mardle 5th February 2022, 12:15 pm That would be nice! I recently spent several hours going through a list of packages installed on my Buster and deciding which ones to install on Bullseye. (I haven’t used the latter for long enough to tell how successful I’ve been. I’ll also need to copy/adapt my own stuff.) Reply to Bruce Mardle Avatar Alan Robertson 10th November 2021, 12:17 pm I’ve just installed bullseye on my Pi 4 8GB (onto SSD) – I’m finding virtual desktop via NoMachine is much slower than it was with buster, I’m guessing this is due to the new window manager? Has anyone else noticed this or come across any fixes? Reply to Alan Robertson Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 10th November 2021, 4:13 pm We’ve just pushed a bunch of updates which will hopefully help with this – if you update your Pi, you should hopefully notice that remote desktop speeds are better! Reply to Simon Long Avatar Alan Robertson 10th November 2021, 6:10 pm Thanks, Simon – just did and update &amp; upgrade and it pulled in about 20 packages with updates (vs this morning). Did a reboot but still the same issue with incredibly laggy response times (SSH is snappy and CPU load on top is in single digits). I’m not sure if it’s related but I’ve also noticed window headings and the top of the wastepaper bin are hidden under the taskbar across the top of the screen. I tried with a screen connected and it was much more responsive both via direct access and via NoMachine. I then rebooted in headless mode and it was again laggy. Not sure if that helps or not? Reply to Alan Robertson Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 10th November 2021, 6:20 pm Can you try opening a terminal, running “ps ax”, and seeing if you have either openbox or mutter running – there should only be one or the other. If you have enabled the in-built VNC server, you should have openbox rather than mutter. However, your mention of NoMachine (with which I am not familiar) makes me wonder if you are using that instead of VNC? If so, you will be using mutter rather than openbox, which causes the problem. Try just enabling VNC in Raspberry Pi Configuration (on the Interfaces tab) – enabling it will disable mutter, and will probably still work with NoMachine. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Alan Robertson 10th November 2021, 7:07 pm Hi Simon – yep mutter was running. Have enabled VNC in raspi-config and rebooted and as you say it is now openbox instead. The resolution won’t rescale (so stuck at 1024×768) but it is at least useable now! Interestingly my Pi 400 (running buster) is still more responsive and does scale, etc. but I can work away and see if any further tweaks I can do there – I’ll mainly be accessing it via SSH or web interface anyway so it’s not a major problem. Thanks for your help! Avatar Dom 18th December 2021, 4:34 pm Speaking of mutter and performance, is it expected on a pi4 4GB for mutter to take 200% of one CPU as soon as I move a terminal (as shown by top)? Had to switch back to openbox to be able to browse on Chromium (after having enabled all the hardware-acceleration parameters for Chromium too). That’s on a Pi-Imager stock image + update/upgrade… Avatar Guibert 11th November 2021, 10:06 am Thank you Simon. Very happy now !

This gives me a segmentation fault when opening. Don’t know if it’s only me or of someone else has the same issue. Reply to Luis Velazquez Avatar Edgar Neukirchner 10th November 2021, 3:08 pm I have some issues with headless operation under xrdp: 1) When connecting to a Raspberry Pi 4 via xrdp under user “pi”, openbox manager is not started. So top panel and window decoration are missing. If I add a new user, e.g. “testuser”, everything just works fine. (Side note: if I choose “Desktop Autologin” in raspi-config, user “pi” just gets an empty screen after login.) 2) Regardless of the username, after login I always get this annoying window “Authentication is required to refresh the system repositories”.

Reply to David King Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 10th November 2021, 10:57 pm No, it will continue to be maintained. But it tends to be the last thing we do in a release cycle – at the end of the day, we’re in the business of selling computers rather than providing free software for other people’s computers! It will get a bullseye update once the dust has settled from the ARM release – we’ve got no intention of abandoning it.

The VLC audio issue I had seems to have sorted itself out on my Pi 400. Not sure how or what I did but great result. On another note, and not sure if this has already been mentioned, the Bullseye update has removed the ability for me to preview pics in a folder as thumbnails. I’ve increased the file limit size in the display preferences as mentioned on another forum but…nothing….not even one preview. On the older OS Version it mostly worked (it displayed around 90% of pics as thumbnails in a directory) but Bullseye doesn’t preview thumbnails at all for me. Has anyone come across this? Any other setting I can play with? A big thank you again to the Raspberry Pi team. Thanks for a great product and thanks for all your hard work. Reply to Ziad Khattab Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 11th November 2021, 2:27 pm You just need to enable the “Show Thumbnails” option in the View menu.

Reply to Bojan Strkovski Avatar Ralph Martin 11th November 2021, 8:02 pm To echo an earlier comment – not all RPis are just used for “messing about”, and starting afresh is not an option in a production environment. Why isn’t the ability to upgrade existing installations considered to be an essential requirement? In future, I’d hope for something better than “try this to upgrade, but we can’t guarantee it will work”. Thanks for listening. Reply to Ralph Martin Avatar MW 12th November 2021, 7:36 am This no update between release advice was aired many many years ago, because of the differences between Raspbian &amp; Debian which can / does / will cause issues when newer packages are released (Debian do not support ARMv6 ARMHF). Going forward RPT have stated that they want both ARM32 &amp; ARM64 to be more *Debian Standard* and therefore eventually release updates will be the normality, though I personally suspect that when this happens the RPi 5 with ARM64 OS will be flagship Hardware. I have held of buying a RPi 4B until ARM64 (Debian Bullseye based) RaspiOS is released. As I stated in another response, I believe that RaspiOS (Raspbian) ARM32 should never of been compiled to run on RPi 4.. Reply to MW Avatar Peter Vincent 11th November 2021, 8:44 pm Just to let you know that since VNC screen resolution was fixed, I can no longer connect a real monitor with VNC enabled. The monitor shuts off almost as soon as the boot starts and VNC resolves to a stamp-sized window (so only had raspi-config to play with via SSH). Only solution seemed to be to turn VNC off when using the monitor then turn it back on after it was disconnected again.

Reply to Geo Tech &amp; More! Avatar HPCguy 12th November 2021, 3:06 am For those of us who want to stick with Debian Buster just a while longer before we switch, is that still an option?

This was not mentined in the article, but I think it’s important to point out. Thank you. Reply to HPCguy Avatar MW 12th November 2021, 7:18 am Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) Buster ARM32 will still be supported, just like previous releases for several months. APT upgrade / full-upgrade will still keep Buster as Buster. Only changing Sources will change release !! Reply to MW Avatar Raspberry Pi Staff Simon Long — post author 12th November 2021, 11:23 am Unless you change the distribution names in your apt config files from “buster” to “bullseye”, then all apt operations will still only get buster changes. You are quite safe continuing to run sudo apt update / full-upgrade operations on a buster image; it won’t pull in any parts of bullseye. Reply to Simon Long Avatar Geert Vancompernolle 12th November 2021, 4:10 am Is it worth the effort to do the switch from Buster to Bullseye if you only use the RPi in headless mode? Reply to Geert Vancompernolle Avatar Rob K 12th November 2021, 5:58 am Any way to force 1080p on this while connected to a 4K display? Defaulting to 4k is by far one of my least favorite features of the Pi 4. I don’t use 4k on my main PC, on a 32″ display, with an RTX 3090. Why the hell would I want to default to 4k on a Raspberry Pi (especially on the 43″ TV I use)? I’ve edited the config file, changed the resolution in the OS, etc. It keeps defaulting to 4k, no matter the changes I make.

Reply to Nick Pettefar Avatar Robert Oliver 13th November 2021, 9:00 am I assume that’s tongue in cheek😀 Reply to Robert Oliver Avatar Regis Michel LeClerc 13th November 2021, 12:12 am I got a brand new RPi Zero 2 W just at the time this new version as released. The 32 bit version sounded logical, so that’s what I installed. However, I suspect this Gnome3 may be a bit “fat” for 512MB as running Arduino (the goal for this system) always fails with “Java heap space” and Chrome just hangs the system when it’s not the only program launched. Looking at the conversations above, I wonder if it would change anything to burn a 64bit beta image? Would it work better if I plug a SSD on the USB and define 16GB swap like I did on my Orange Pi PC2 (it’s running Armbian in 64 bits, but the RPi02W is much faster when it comes to anything graphical)? Would it be advisable to run Epiphany rather than Chrome? Reply to Regis Michel LeClerc Avatar Robert Oliver 13th November 2021, 8:59 am Great to see. The negative comments are strange – if you are using for business you need to risk assess when is the appropriate time to upgrade and what are the benefits – as per all o/s suppliers. It is commendable that the organisation seek to remain backward compatible other companies just leave you in the lurch without support and you have to upgrade your hardware Reply to Robert Oliver Avatar Rob Versluis 13th November 2021, 10:00 am Missing include file: /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/sys/io.h Under PiOS 10 its available.

Guidance please on is this beta still pertaining to the camera and video? I did a day of research online and troubleshooting: even the cameras and ribbons. They’re fine. Reply to TimC Liz Upton Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 14th November 2021, 10:44 am Afraid not. Raspicam and Raspistill are no longer supported (we’ve been very clear this would have to happen – I’m sorry you missed it) and you’ll need to be using libcamera now. If you find yourself struggling with this sort of issue, the documentation should always be your first stop for research. See https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#libcamera-and-the-legacy-raspicam-camera-stack for absolutely everything you’ll need on the topic. David Plowman also has a blog post coming next week on the changes (and why they’re a big improvement for users), so please keep an eye out.

I see that there have been problems. There are no lags and I can set a resolution for headless usage. The VNC windows appears in that new size after reboot, but the Desktop is still 640×480 pixels an can be seen in the upper left corner. Rest of the VNC window is black.

I only was able to see the “-” char on the top left screen. I comment out the following section at file /boot/config.txt # Enable DRM VC4 V3D driver #dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d #max_framebuffers=2 Since that change I’m able to see the desktop on my HDMI monitor.

I installed and updated it over the weekend, so it took advantage of the fixes that had been made. #1 I was able to get headless mode working immediately with no problems, and found the VNC Resolution settings in raspi-config. #2 I like to use the Plank docking system, but it puts a thick black bar across the bottom of the screen, taking up valuable screen real estate. #3 I can’t install Cairo-dock because of a problem with a library — “The following packages have unmet dependencies: gnome-settings-daemon : Depends: gnome-settings-daemon-common (= 3.38.2-1) but 3.38.2-1+rpt1 is to be installed ” #4 I can’t install MEGASync, but that is a problem with the MEGA people, not yours. They haven’t updated to Raspbian 11 yet #5 Under Raspbian 10 Buster, I was able to set hdmi_mode=84 in /boot/config.txt, giving me 2048×1152. Under Bullseye, changing the setting in config.txt doesn’t work. I am l limited to what raspi-config allows me, which is 1920×1080. Those extra100-odd pixels each way make using LibreOffice Writer more pleasant. These are all little things. Everything else seems to work — Webmin, Plexmediaserver, SMB sharing, AFP sharing, NFS sharing, Bind name server, and these are the main things I use my RPi 4 for. It also works nicely off a Toshiba XC10 SSD drive. Thank you again. Reply to David Avatar David 16th November 2021, 11:30 pm Ok, I was able to get MEGASync working. I needed to install the libraw19 library, (libraw20 is already installed) from a Debian repository. Once that was done, MEGASync was able to be installed, configured, and is now running. Reply to David Avatar Del Mar Dial 7th January 2022, 5:53 am Hey David, I am still more less a noob with Linux but learning. How the heck did you get Megasync installed?

A little on the glitchy side, but I’m good at deglitching, so no matter. I had the previous os on mine overclocked, but this one hardly needs overclocking. I like it even more than u buntu! It is GREAT for games! I didn’t know a raspberry pi 4 8gb could possibly be soooo fast! I use a raspberry pi for my main computer because it is third party, and It does not have all the extra over-heating hardware that a normal laptop does. My laptop overheats when I play these games like sauerbraten. Technically, now, the raspberry pi 4b with a ice tower heatsink is more powerful than an hp pavillion!

I recently switched to the 64-bit version of Raspberry OS and I Don’t Like it because it is buggy, whereas the 32-bit version was stable, stable. I am very disappointed that Raspberry OS is so far behind, Gtk+ 4.0 isn’t even readily available to install. Half or more of the functions described online have been deprecated, yet I struggled to find working replacements. It would be great if Raspberry OS would include Gtk+ 4.0 Before Gtk+ 5.0 is released, likely 10 or 15 years from now.

Reply to Ph11 Avatar Dean 20th November 2021, 10:44 pm I used the Raspberry Pi Imager to write the Bullseye image, and it seemed to be successful. But when I tried to boot my RPi 4 (8G) I repeatedly got the rainbow screen followed by a message saying it was resizing the space and would reboot in 5. Which it did, but then, when it was rebooting, the rainbow screen flashed up briefly, followed by a black screen, then a shutdown. I re-imaged, using a different SD card, with the same results. I re-imaged again and attempted to boot another RPi 4, but the same sequence occurred. I re-wrote the eeprom, making sure the green light on the RPi was flashing, re-imaged a card, and once again tried to boot it up — with the same result. Disappointed, I went back to Buster. Oh well… Reply to Dean Avatar alice ace 21st November 2021, 12:17 am So are all previously sold DSI screens (including those of third parties) unavailable?

Do I have to upgrade all my Pi to Bullseye? can I/should I upgrade Buster Samba to 4.13.13? is there another solution? Reply to andrew Avatar andrew 21st November 2021, 3:15 am A little further investigation indicates that mount.cifs in Buster needs upgrading which needs a kernel re-compile that I am not excited about doing.Are there other options, as it looks as if I am being forced to upgrade all my Pi to Bullseye, and using NFS during the transition Reply to andrew Avatar L.

Hamilton 26th November 2021, 4:21 pm An odd example: Hercules emulating Z/architecture (for example, to run 64-bit Linux – I gather that some of the work on that is done under Hercules, since most people don’t have a mainframe in their spare room), while it can run on 32-bit, is said to perform better on 64-bit; presumably the wider registers and ability to address more memory both help. It would much amuse me to run mainframe code on something the size of a cigarette pack – even if it wouldn’t be all that fast. My last three phones run 64-bit. :-) Seems like 64-bit should be getting more and more attention, and 32-bit should be getting a bit less, although still security and stability fixes for some time.

Reply to JRobinson333 Avatar Sanjib Acharya 23rd December 2021, 7:27 am Hi All, I have a Raspberry Pi 4b (4GB) model. Using a 16 GB microSD card. So far, with Buster 10, it was okay for me except occasional troubles with WiFi, which was bearable and could get some work around. Now when I switch to Bullseye 32-bit version, I am going through a hail for the last two days. Imaged the uSD card with the RPi Bullseye 32-bit image. Let the system bootup. The WiFi does not work with the highest resolution. I had to reduce the resolution for the WiFi to comeup. Again, just to switch to a more reliable method, I used an USB dongle for WiFi, which uses Wlan1 and apparently works ok with lower resolution. But as soon I upgrade the firmware as the system pops up about the updates available, it takes almost 30 minutes or more for me upgrate, but after reboot, the the screen stays blank…does not complete booting up. Did this whole process almost 3 times so far. Did not find a suitable resolution for this yet. Any suggestions please? I am not a Linux expert, merely a beginner.

I suspect the issue is the bug the gpsd people have now fixed, which hasn’t been propagated to the current bullseye Reply to Jeremy Harding Avatar Dennis Mullins 19th January 2022, 9:10 pm For Raspberry Pi 4 running Mutter WM –Will you be restoring normal operation of Alt Tab with icons and selection of any open window ? Will you be restoring capability to add custom keyboard shortcuts ? Reply to Dennis Mullins Avatar Steve Gale 20th January 2022, 1:07 pm Hi, I have just updated my PI4 8Gb to Bullseye to try it out. I have had trouble detecting the second TV but finally got two displays to work, However the second TV does not display a picture no matter what I select in appearance settings. The taskbar will move between TV’s, I can move applications onto the second TV. So it does work, just curious as to why I can’t display an image. If I revert to my Buster SD card then I get an image on both TV’s, so I do not believe it is a problemwith my hardware configuration.

Together, the two actors completed radio adaptations of every story in the canon of Sherlock Holmes between 1989 and 1998. Sherlock HolmesGenre Radio drama Country of origin United Kingdom Home station BBC Radio 4 Starring Clive Merrison Michael Williams Original release 5 November 1989 (1989-11-05) – 5 July 1998 (1998-07-05) The episodes were not originally broadcast under an overall title, and aired in series with the same titles as the novels or short story collections that the episodes were adapted from. For instance, the first two episodes were based on the novel A Study in Scarlet and aired under that title on BBC Radio 4's Classic Serial programme.[1] Episodes of the series are available on CD as well as downloads, and are occasionally rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.[2] Contents 1 Production 2 Episodes 2.1 A Study In Scarlet 2.2 The Sign of the Four 2.3 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes 2.4 The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes 2.5 The Return of Sherlock Holmes 2.6 His Last Bow 2.7 The Case-book of Sherlock Holmes 2.8 The Valley of Fear 2.9 The Hound of the Baskervilles 3 The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes 3.1 Episodes 4 See also 5 References ProductionEdit The BBC decided to produce radio adaptations of all sixty Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle due to the success of a 1988 radio adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles.[3] David Johnston produced and directed the production, which was adapted by Bert Coules, and starred Roger Rees as Sherlock Holmes and Crawford Logan as Dr. Watson.[4] For the complete series of adaptations, Clive Merrison was cast as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Both of the first two dramatisations of the series, adaptations of A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of the Four, were produced by David Johnston and directed by Ian Cotterell. Enyd Williams produced and directed the adaptation of The Valley of Fear and the 1998 version of The Hound of the Baskervilles. Each of the fifty-six short story adaptations were produced and directed by either Enyd Williams or Patrick Rayner. The head writer for the series was Bert Coules. The other writers were David Ashton, Michael Bakewell, Roger Danes, Robert Forrest, Denys Hawthorne, Gerry Jones, Peter Ling, Vincent McInerney and Peter Mackie.[3] The broadcast of the last dramatisation, the 1998 version of The Hound of the Baskervilles, marked the first time that the same two actors had played Holmes and Watson in dramatisations of all sixty stories on radio[5] or any other medium.[2] This was not accomplished again until 2016 when the American radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was completed.[6] It had almost been accomplished in the 1930s radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in which all but one of the stories (The Valley of Fear) were adapted.[7] Bert Coules wrote a book about the radio dramatisations of the Sherlock Holmes canon. The book, titled 221 BBC, also includes information about the follow-up BBC radio series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.[8] EpisodesEdit A Study In ScarletEdit Two one-hour episodes adapted from A Study In Scarlet were recorded October 1989, at BBC studios, Maida Vale, London and first broadcast on 5 and 12 November 1989.

                   NS1:content=" 小鹤音形 – 不用选字，四键打字的输入方案 Android Windows 2021/12/15 Poto 49 小鹤音形 - 不用选字，四键打字的输入方案 作者 Poto，原文：https://meta.appinn.net/t/topic/28388 为什么你应该使用小鹤音形 小鹤音形是一款让你不用选字的字词输入法，支持 Windows 与 Android，四码上屏，有词打词，无词拆单。字词输入方式是我心里想输入什么我就确定会打出什么的输入方式 小鹤音形带给你最大的好处是，你不需要选字，绝大多数的常用字四键上屏。是的，你敲四个键，就能打出任何你想打的字，你不需要费劲半天去翻 N 页选字。这就是小鹤音形给你打字的效率提升。 单此一点，就足以让你有理由学习小鹤音形。 小鹤音形 - 不用选字，四键打字的输入方案 1 生僻字 另外的一个好处是，小鹤音形让你始终能够打出字来。有时候，有些生僻字，我们是不晓得发音的，但是却知道怎么写。这时你就可以只用鹤形打，照样能把这个字打出来。 比如「犇」这个字，生僻字发音我们可能一时半会想不起来。这时你就可以用小鹤音形的鹤形 “nn 把这个字打出来。没音照样打。 这就是小鹤音形带给你的好处 – 让你始终能打出字来。无论是全拼还是双拼，你忘了拼音你就打不出来。而小鹤音形赋予你更多的可能，让你始终能把字打出来。 毕竟，我们用输入方案打字，是为了把字打出来。只要能抓到老鼠，不管黑猫白猫，都是好猫。 四键 小鹤音形的用键是比双拼更少的，更比全拼少。单字小鹤音形基本能在一二三键敲出来。而二字或以上词语，小鹤音形最多只需四键，而双拼要用五键七键九键（分别指二三四字词）。 很多人觉得自己全拼或双拼就很好啊，不需要换。事实上，拼音方案由于同音字太多，随之产生词、短语和整句等输入方式来避免同音字太多的不便，甚至产生了基于程序自动匹配的所谓智能输入方式。这种智能输入法让你需要养词库，并且容易打错别字。 而小鹤音形这种形码方案，是以打字词为主的非智能输入方案。以单字为主，指哪打哪，想打什么就打什么。你不需要依赖输入法，你只靠你自己。你花一星期掌握了，之后受用一生。 一个趁手的输入方案学习，和学历一样值得投资。 小鹤音形是怎样的 小鹤音形的单字编码为前两码双拼后两码双形（鹤形），双拼是较为出名的小鹤双拼，鹤形的作用是分离同音字，精准到字。 小鹤音形是可高可低的输入方案，万能键让你可以降格用双拼打，也可以只用双形打。一个字，用音形，四码上屏；如果你不懂形，你用万能键，降格为小鹤双拼打；如果你忘了发音，可以只用鹤形打。 举个例子。 形字，全拼 xing，双拼 xk, 双形 kp，音形 xkkp。如果你掌握了小鹤音形，你自可以用音形打，四码上屏，不用选字。如果你忘了发音，但是记得字型，你可以用 “ kp 打。如果你忘了字型，你用双拼 xk` 打。 小鹤双拼用两键就能打出拼音的声韵母，两键打出所有汉字，简化全拼打字的麻烦。但双拼只是简化全拼击键的次数，仍然需要选字。 对于不想选字的朋友，你需要进阶「小鹤音形」。 打够 500 字就能掌握小鹤音形！ 小鹤音形无论双拼还是鹤形都是有规律，基于拼音和字型结构衍生出来的输入方案。 正所谓万变不离其宗。我在走过许多歪路后，总结出以下的学习路线。双拼和鹤形同步学习，两驾马车齐步走。同时学习双拼和鹤形。 双拼 双拼有一首诗辅助你记忆。理解了诗，你就能了解双拼的键位。 Qiu Wei Ruan T_ue_ve Yun U_shu I_chi Song_iong Dai Fen Geng Hang J_an 秋 闱 软 月 云 梳 翅 松 拥 黛 粉 更 航 安 Kuai_ing Liang_uang Zou Xia_ua Pie Cao V_zhui_v Bin Niao Mian 快 莺 两 望 奏 夏 蛙 撇 草 追 鱼 滨 鸟 眠 鹤形 鹤形的键位采用的是象形字相似原则。你只需结合以下字根键位图，理解这里的例字，你就能基本熟悉鹤形字根。 你就能用小鹤音形打字。 image.png 最后，完成以上两步，你就基本能掌握小鹤音形。你不需要读晦涩的规则，这只会让你觉得头大和感到麻烦而畏惧不前。这些会在之后你慢慢和自然而然地掌握的。 之后，你把自己的输入法改成小鹤音形，除却必要的工作和学习，在日常中要求自己使用小鹤音形打字，只要自己打够 500 个字，就是自己独立打够 500 个字，用音形打，没有查字。即为出师。 如果你想要彻底掌握小鹤音形，你需要了解音形的规则和以下表格，方便你更娴熟和高效地指尖飞舞。 字数 规则 例词 全码 二字词 首字前两码 + 末字前两码 双拼 ulpb 三字词 前两字首码 + 末字前两码 输入法 urfa 四字词 四字首码 小鹤音形 xhyx 以上词 前三字首码 + 末字首码 他乡遇故知 txyv 为什么我撰写本文 很多人觉得音形很难，甚至经常看到劝说别人全拼或双拼就够的建议。事实上，建议应该是由使用过全拼、双拼和其他输入方案的人提出，因为他们接触过，理解过，才知道什么好，什么不好。 如果你想学对你有帮助的输入方案，结果全拼的用户跟你说全拼好，就全拼得了；双拼的用户跟你说，双拼就够用啦，还费劲学什么。你会不会感觉哪里不对。 有更好的输入方案当然想去学。而我作为小鹤音形的用户，看到很多人止步于双拼，可能有些人也受不了选字的麻烦，所以我撰写本文，希望让他们知道，世界上有不用选字，四键打字的输入方案。 让他们知道他们有其他可能更适合自己的选择。 参考阅读 输入法下载 小鹤音形官网 查字工具- 选中就能查打法：小鹤查形 小鹤音形入门 " />

                   NS1:content="Big Finish: Doctor Who - Top Ten Tom Baker Audio Adventures Wednesday, January 20, 2021 Moo celebrates the legendary voice’s birthday. tom%2Bbaker It’s hard to overstate the amount of love for Tom Baker that we Doctor Who fans have. To so many he isn’t just that guy who played the 4th Doctor – He is simply THE Doctor. A big part of why he is so beloved is his voice. It booms and echoes and fills the room, it commands attention and is almost an established Doctor Who character in and of itself. So it’s no surprise that Big Finish have made the most of the opportunity to get as much out of him as possible. Here are ten of my favourite stories from them that feature Tom Baker. someone%2Bi%2Bonce%2Bknes 10. Someone I Once Knew This is the concluding story in one of Big Finish’s River Song boxsets so you need to hear it in context to appreciate it. In this set River has been in conflict with the demon-alien Discordia, and for the final story to reverse the damage done she has to team up with her husband… the wrong version, but the Doctor all the same. While there’s essentially no reason why it has to be the Fourth Doctor, it really works. Tom Baker and Alex Kingston play off each other really well and together they totally sell the relationship between the two. It’s a beautiful story, this one. the%2Bsyndicate%2Bmasterplan 9. The Syndicate Masterplan I’m not sure who decided that a sequel to 1965-66 mostly-missing twelve-part epic The Daleks’ Master Plan was a necessary thing in 2019, but the eighth series of Big Finish’s Fourth Doctor Adventures range was exactly that. The Syndicate Masterplan is a mix of standalone and arc-based stories but they must all be heard together to appreciate it. The overall story picks up the pieces after the First Doctor’s adventure and throws the Fourth and his new companion WPC Ann Kelso into the fallout. It’s a treat for fans of 60s-era Who, with lots of great twists and turns that make for a compelling experience. the%2Bfoe%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bfuture 8. The Foe From the Future This “lost story” was one of two six-parters considered to conclude season 14 back in the 70s. In the end they made The Talons of Weng-Chiang, but luckily the other option survives in the form of this Big Finish adaptation. Despite being a six-part story without visuals it never drags, with many changes in setting and a strong supporting cast working to keep it moving along at pace. All the strengths of the Hinchcliffe era of the show are on display to create a story that it’s a damn shame we didn’t get in the 70s but that I’m really pleased we still got to experience in this form. night%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bvashda 7. Night of the Vashta Nerada Doctor Who visits the happiest planet in the galaxy: Funworld. Which immediately tells you that the story which follows will be anything but happy or fun! And that’s not a bad thing, because it’s a great story. The imagery is dark and morbid, but it works on audio allowing the listener to paint a picture that a 70s budget never could. Without a companion, this story forces the Doctor to shine on his own terms, and he does. Seeing him work out the rules of this all-time great monster as it slowly picks off the guest cast one by one, the Fourth Doctor is on fine form here. A wonderful showcase for what this incarnation is like when the pressure is really on. Any fan of Tom Baker’s Doctor should check out this story. the%2Blight%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bend 6. The Light at the End The 50th Anniversary audio special brings eight Doctors together, including number four. This is a treat for fans in so many ways, but perhaps none more than hearing Tom Baker’s Fourth Doctor team-up with Paul McGann’s Eighth. The two spend most of the runtime together as the others go off on their own separate tangents, resulting in what is one of the best two-Doctor team-ups in any multi-Doctor story to date. These two go so well together that I could easily see a full series of adventures for them working out well. Add this to a fun story with all the Doctors and the Master’s latest plot and you’ve got a recipe for success. star%2Bbeast 5. Doctor Who and the Star Beast This is a very different story! Adapted from an old comic strip, you know from that fact alone that what will follow is a unique experience (and that’s a good thing). In this story, the Doctor goes up against Beep the Meep, a little rat-like creature who’s cutesy-cuddly appearance covers a dark sinister evil streak. It’s exactly the sort of thing that the TV series would never pull off but that expanded media is placed perfectly to pull-off, making for a story that is nothing but a delight to listen to. out%2Bof%2Btime 4. Out of Time Look at that cover and then tell me if I need to justify this story’s inclusion. Tenth Doctor and Fourth Doctor vs Daleks! What more is there to say? The two most iconic Doctors and their most iconic villain all in one place, sign me up! But despite all those elements, you need to have a good story to deliver on the potential. I’m pleased to report that that’s what we got. Although the Tenth takes the lead, the Fourth is given plenty of good material. The setting of the story outside of time is a terrific concept done well, and it allows for the multi-Doctor interactions to carry the story from just being competent fanservice into something that is essential listening. the%2Bcrooked%2Bman 3. The Crooked Man It starts off in a coastal town where the Doctor and Leela discover a series of grisly murders. As the pair investigate they learn of “the crooked man”, a figure from an obscure story who feeds on imagination and lives to kill. So how can something fictional be killing real people? The answer is discovered when the Doctor and Leela end up in the land of fiction, this time doing battle not with classical literary figures but ideas by unpublished hacks. Genius idea realised to perfection, cannot recommend it enough. the%2Btrouble%2Bwith%2Bdrax 2. The Trouble With Drax I’m not sure who decided that a memorable side-character from one of the less popular Tom Baker serials was worthy of a full-blown sequel, but I’m not complaining. It starts off with the Doctor and Romana being recruited by a newly-regenerated Drax for his latest scheme, and it spirals from there. This story has one joke but the increasingly outlandish ways it gets delivered each time will see you go from impressed to amused to actually standing up to applaud. Proof if we needed it that the same joke can be funny again and again if creative ways are found to land the punchline, it’s a real achievement that a story like this can exist and work as well as it does. kill%2Bthe%2Bdoctor 1. Kill the Doctor! / The Age of Sutekh Taking a memorable one-off villain and turning him into an idea, a purely abstract concept rather than a tangible presence, living in a wireless cloud. This is the sort of thing that Doctor Who should be doing with the vast array of characters in the back catalogue of stories, and it works really well for Sutekh the Destroyer. This two-parter is also a great showcase for Leela giving her a very modern side-story as the Doctor gets caught up in things. There’s a very powerful story here, and it’s a shame how little attention it has been given since. IMHO this is what Big Finish should be doing more of, as it tops my list of favourite Tom Baker audio adventures. Which one is your favourite? “Moo” is the pseudonym used by this Doctor Who fan. He can usually be found procrastinating by thinking about Doctor Who. Follow him on Twitter @z_p_moo for more of his unusual takes, but do so at your own risk.

The &quot;Dalek Wars&quot; were the series of conflicts that involved forces of the universe, primarily humans, battling the Daleks, a species that sought to conquer the universe by exterminating all other forms of life.

Davros unleashed the newly-created Daleks into the Thal Dome at the wars' end. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks) Over the centuries, the Thals and the Daleks remained largely isolated from each other until one Thal tribe ventured into the petrified jungle, near the Dalek City, in search of food. The Daleks attempted to wipe the Thals out by bombarding Skaro's surface with radiation, on which the Daleks had become dependent. However, with the help of the First Doctor and his companions, the Thals raided the Dalek City and severed their power supply. (TV: The Daleks) Fifty cycles later, surviving Daleks attacked the new Thal City but, once again with the First Doctor's assistance, the Thals drove them back. The Dalek City was largely devastated, although the Thals resolved to remain alert to any other potential Dalek settlements elsewhere on Skaro. (AUDIO: Return to Skaro) The Thals later remembered this period as &quot;the Dalek war&quot;, which Vaber recalled took place generations prior to 2540. (TV: Planet of the Daleks) It was also known to them as the &quot;First Dalek War&quot;. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Planet of the Daleks) The Thals' wars against the Daleks continued for many centuries after this period. (PROSE: War of the Daleks, The Evil of the Daleks) First Dalek War Main article: 22nd century Dalek invasion Dalekinvasion 201.jpg The 22nd century Dalek occupation of the Earth. (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth) The first full-scale conflict between the Daleks and humanity was the Dalek invasion of Earth during the 22nd century, also known to the latter as the First Dalek War. (PROSE: Prelude Deceit) The war resulted from various Dalek encounters with human culture as the fledgling Dalek Empire expanded. The Dalek Emperor declared human characteristics a dangerous incompatibility with the Dalek way of life and began mobilising the Empire for &quot;all-out war on all human beings... everywhere.&quot; (COMIC: Shadow of Humanity, The Emissaries of Jevo) After the emergency landing of the Earth ship, the Starmaker, on Skaro, the Daleks discovered the coordinates of Earth. (COMIC: The Road to Conflict) Although the Dalek Fleet was initially repelled after first venturing into the solar system, (COMIC: Return of the Elders) the Daleks returned after bombarding the Earth with meteorites and began a ten-year occupation of the planet and others in the star system in 2157. Seeking to transform the planet into a massive spaceship, the whole invasion fleet was blown apart in the explosion which resulted from their bomb being jammed in place below their base. (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth) In the 2180s, the Dalek Time Controller led a second invasion, but it was ultimately halted by the interference of the Eighth Doctor. (AUDIO: Lucie Miller, To the Death) The Daleks remained bitter about the failed conquest of the Earth, and even identified the Doctor as an enemy responsible for their defeat. (TV: The Chase) Second Dalek War Main article: Second Dalek War Second Dalek War.jpg The Dalek Fleet by the end of the Second Dalek War. (PROSE: Prisoner of the Daleks) In 2520, the brief but destructive Human-Draconian War broke out as the Earth Empire and Draconian Empire. (TV: Frontier in Space) Although it did not involve the Daleks, it was used as the launch pad for their next invasion (AUDIO: The Dalek Conquests) and it formed part of the numerous wars of the period. (PROSE: The Chase) In 2540, with the aid of the Master and the Ogrons, the Daleks attempted to drive the two empires into another war, planning to invade in the aftermath. The Third Doctor exposed the deception and the humans and Draconians united to face a common enemy. (TV: Frontier in Space) With Time Lord intervention, the Doctor was diverted to Spiridon to delay the awakening of the Dalek Army with the aid of the Thals. However, the Dalek Supreme considered the setback a delay, not a defeat. (TV: Planet of the Daleks) Eventually, the Second Dalek War began, with Earth and Draconia uniting to face the Daleks. (PROSE: Love and War) After the First Dalek Incursion, which destroyed many planets, the the war lasted around another forty years. (PROSE: Prisoner of the Daleks) During the period, refugees fleeing the Dalek Wars were resettled on planets such as Axista Four, although one stated date indicated this took place in 2539, one year before the Second Dalek War began, unless different dating systems were used. (PROSE: The Colony of Lies) Towards its end, the Daleks sought to exploit the Arkheon Threshold to change human history. The Tenth Doctor and a team of bounty hunters led by Jon Bowman destroyed the flagship of Dalek X, the Dalek Inquisitor General, and Earth forces attacked the Dalek base on Arkheon, after which the Doctor closed the rift. The Supreme Dalek's war machine was thrown into chaos, (PROSE: Prisoner of the Daleks) leading to the &quot;untidy&quot; end of the war as it subsequently &quot;fizzled out&quot;. (PROSE: Deceit) Third Dalek War Main article: Third Dalek War DomeBang.jpg The Third Dalek War was largely defined by the Dalek Plague and the Exxilon Gambit. (PROSE: Death to the Daleks) The Second Dalek War was followed by &quot;another Dalek War&quot;. (PROSE: Deceit) The Third Dalek War broke out in the same period as its predecessor and the Human-Draconian war. It supposedly occurred prior to Steven Taylor's native time period, although this was in itself an inconsistent marker. (PROSE: The Chase) During the war, the Lucifer star system was of paramount strategic importance but it was denied to both sides by a black hole-generated exclusion zone. (PROSE: Lucifer Rising) the Daleks launched plague missiles at the Outer Worlds of the Earth Empire, sparking a devastating outbreak of space plague. In response, Earth forces travelled to Exxilon to acquire the only known cure, parrinium. The Daleks followed them to prevent this, leading to the Exxilon Gambit. (PROSE: The Secret Lives of Monsters) On Exxilon, the Marine Space Corps and the Daleks were stranded by the Great City of the Exxilons and agreed on a temporary truce. After the city was brought down, the Daleks left the planet with the mineral. However, their supplies had been replaced by bags of sand and the ship was blow up by Dan Galloway, who stowed away on board. The human survivors returned the parrinium to the Outer Worlds, saving millions of lives. The father of Peter Hamilton, one of the Marines on the mission, had been a casualty of &quot;the last Dalek war.&quot; (TV: Death to the Daleks) The Exxilon Gambit marked the last act of the Third Dalek War. (PROSE: The Secret Lives of Monsters) The high casualty rate among the Earth Empire, compounded with those suffered in the previous Dalek Wars of the period, put a stop to Earth's expansionist era. (PROSE: The Chase) Great War Main article: Great War (The Evil of the Daleks) During the 36th century, the Daleks disappeared from human space and pursued conflicts elsewhere. (TV: Mission to the Unknown) In the 40th century, they returned and attacked some human targets (AUDIO: The Destroyers) but these incursions remained top secret. (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan, AUDIO: The Guardian of the Solar System) The Space Security Service became involved in other conflicts, with species like the Sontarans. (AUDIO: The Sontarans) A non-aggression pact was signed in 3975, (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan) but in 3984, the Seventh Doctor told Bernice Summerfield that a &quot;massive Dalek war&quot; was to start in &quot;about thirty years time&quot;. (PROSE: Legacy) In 3999, Mavic Chen, the Guardian of the Solar System, secretly struck a deal with the Daleks in a bid to defend Earth's influence. (AUDIO: The Guardian of the Solar System) In 4000, the Daleks amassed the Great Alliance, planning a huge assault on the solar system using a time-manipulating doomsday weapon, the Time Destructor. Chen sought to usurp the weapon for himself and turn on the Daleks, but he became power-mad and was eventually killed by the Daleks. The First Doctor was able to steal the Time Destructor and turned it against the Daleks, wiping out the invasion force on Kembel. (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan) When the plans were discovered by Earth forces, (PROSE: The Mutation of Time) the Great War began against the Daleks. Humanity, the Thals, the Draconians and the Terran Federation all became involved in the millennium-long conflict. (PROSE: The Evil of the Daleks) Fighting broke out around the 4010s. The war resulted in the Galactic Federation being torn apart and forced to re-evaluate itself in the aftermath. As the planet Peladon was an ex-member of the Federation, they avoided Dalek attack. (PROSE: Legacy) The SSS fought in the war in the 41st century. At one point it’s council gained of intelligence of a coming Dalek attack but chose to do nothing to safeguard the source. (AUDIO: The House of Kingdom) Dalek Cival War.jpg The Dalek Civil War ended the Great War. (TV: The Evil of the Daleks) Eventually, facing total defeat, (PROSE: The Evil of the Daleks) the Dalek Emperor devised a plan to infect humanity with the Dalek factor, turning them mentally into obedient Daleks. The Second Doctor was blackmailed into aiding the Daleks with the operation. By pretending to cooperate, he was able to infect many of the Daleks on Skaro with the human factor, igniting the Dalek Civil War which nearly destroyed the Daleks forever. (TV: The Evil of the Daleks) Yet the Emperor's forces survived and were able to begin rebuilding. (COMIC: Bringer of Darkness, AUDIO: The Lights of Skaro, PROSE: Doctor Who and the Day of the Daleks) After the Last Great Time War from the Daleks' perspective, they engaged in another war between humans during the 40th century, battling the SSS. It raged for a hundred years, into the 41st century, (COMIC: The Only Good Dalek) overlapping with the original start of the Great War. (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan, PROSE: The Evil of the Daleks) In an alternate timeline in which the Doctor never interfered with the Kembel operations, the Daleks developed the Time Destructor and embarked an uncontested series of conquests. The campaign ended with the attack on Urbinia, after which the timeline was averted by the Second Doctor. (AUDIO: Daughter of the Gods) Second Great Dalek Occupation Main article: Second Great Dalek Occupation Second Great Dalek Occupation.jpg The Second Great Dalek Occupation. (AUDIO: Project Infinity) From their powerbase in the Seriphia Galaxy, the Daleks invaded Mutter’s Spiral, defended by the Earth Alliance, beginning on Vega VI. They employed Susan Mendes as “the Angel of Mercy” to increase slave efficiency. (AUDIO: Invasion of the Daleks) Secretly she worked with her companion, the Knight of Velyshaa Kalendorf, to sow the seeds of rebellion. He telepathically implanted a trigger in the mind of every slave they met to make them revel together. (AUDIO: The Human Factor) After over a decade, the Daleks had conquered almost most of the galaxy, including Earth. Suz used a victory broadcast on Yaldos across the entire Dalek Empire to declare the trigger phrase, “Death to the Daleks!”, to begin the slave rebellion. This threw the Empire into chaos. (AUDIO: “Death to the Daleks!”) Three months later, the Dalek Emperor activated Project Infinity and made contact with Daleks of a parallel universe. These Daleks judged the Daleks as guilty of the worst crimes they’d ever witnessed and declared war on them, allying with the Earth Alliance. (AUDIO: Project Infinity, Dalek War: Chapter One) Enemy-Alliance Dalek War Main article: Enemy-Alliance Dalek War For six years the parallel universe Daleks, now known as the ”Alliance Daleks”, and Earth Alliance, commanded by Kalendorf, fought against the “Enemy Daleks”. The Enemy Daleks were now led only by the Dalek Supreme, (AUDIO: Dalek War: Chapter One) as the Emperor had retreated into Suz‘s mind after being captured at Project Infinity. (AUDIO: Dalek War: Chapter Three) After six years, with the Enemy Daleks nearly defeated, Kalendorf decided to betray the Alliance Daleks, having decided they were simply a more outwardly benign dictatorship. He arranged Suz’s recovery from Alliance Dalek custody and had her give a broadcast as the Angel of Mercy to turn the Earth Alliance against the Alliance Daleks. A truce was formed with the Enemy Daleks, and Kalendorf surrendered Suz to the Dalek Supreme so the Daleks could recover their Emperor. (AUDIO: Dalek War: Chapter Three) After years of fighting, the Alliance Daleks finally retreated back to their universe as their leader, the Mentor, predicted the war would eventually lead to the extinction of all life in Mutter’s Spiral. A fragile truce remained between the Earth Alliance and the Daleks. Kalendorf travelled to Dalek-occupsd Earth to meet the Emperor, discovering it had remained in Suz’s body, now fully possessing her, and intended to break the truce as he’d suspected. Grabbing the Emperor, Kalendorf used his telepathy to briefly reawaken Suz and trigger a command he‘d implanted in Suz’s mind before surrendering her: “Victory or death”. This sent a signal through the Dalek command net ordering all Dalek technology to self-destruct. This annihilated the Daleks and devastated much of the galaxy, becoming known as the Great Catastrophe. (AUDIO: Dalek War: Chapter Four) A single Dalek outpost in the Seriphia Galaxy survived the Catastrophe by channelling then cestrucrive impulse into a single drone. This drone also absorbed the minds of the Emperor and Suz, so was declared the new Dalek Supreme. (AUDIO: The Demons) The Daleks rebuilt in Seriphia and returned to Mutter’s Spiral approximately 2,500 years after the Catastrophe, (AUDIO: Dalek War: Chapter Four, The Exterminators) Human perspective of the Last Great Time War Main article: Last Great Time War From the perspective of humanity, the Daleks suddenly disappeared from time and space after the Tenth Dalek Occupation, (PROSE: A Brief History of Time Lords) during which the Daleks were &quot;the greatest threat in the universe,&quot; as recalled by Jack Harkness, a former Time Agent from the 51st century. The Occupation occurred &quot;thousands of years&quot; prior to the Battle of the Game Station in 200,100. As the Ninth Doctor recalled, they had left to fight the Last Great Time War against the Time Lords. (TV: The Parting of the Ways) War Doctor holding Cinder.jpg The War Doctor grieves for Cinder, (COMIC: The Bidding War) one of the humans involved in the Last Great Time War. (PROSE: Engines of War) According to the Gelth ambassador, the Time War was devastating to &quot;higher forms&quot; but invisible to &quot;smaller species&quot;. (TV: The Unquiet Dead) Jack Harkness originally believed the Time War was just a legend. (TV: The Parting of the Ways) However, humans could become involved in the War if it entered their time zone and area of the universe. Groups of humans became involved in the Time War after the Daleks occupied the Tantalus Spiral, and invaded the planet Moldox. They were aware the war had lasted, from a linear perspective at least, around 400 years. Towards the war's end, during the Battle for the Tantalus Eye, the War Doctor erased the Dalek occupation through massive time manipulation. The humans involved all lost their memories of the war, although the Doctor claimed these memories would eventually resurface. In honour of one of them, Cinder, the Doctor vowed to end the war. (PROSE: Engines of War) Other Dalek wars The Daleks launched an invasion of the solar system (COMIC: Invasion of the Daleks) at the beginning of the 25th century. (PROSE: Break-through!) They were beaten, disarmed and confined to Skaro for &quot;two hundred years&quot;, until the threat of the Mechanical Planet resulted in their freedom and they began a new invasion in the 27th century. (COMIC: The Mechanical Planet) The two-century peace conflicted with accounts of the Second Dalek War during the 26th century. (TV: Frontier in Space, PROSE: Love and War, Prisoner of the Daleks, et al.) It is possible parts of history were altered through time travel. (AUDIO: The Dalek Conquests) The United Planets formed the Anti-Dalek Force to fight in their war against the Daleks. (PROSE: Terror Task Force) A war was fought between the post-Time War Daleks and humanity in which the latter led the Combined Galactic Resistance. (TV: Into the Dalek) The Daleks engaged in a war against the robot Movellans, leading to a stalemate, (TV: Destiny of the Daleks) until the Movellans released the Movellan virus, (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks) an act of biological warfare which devastated the Dalek Empire. The resulting factionalism led to the civil war between the Imperial and Renegade factions, (PROSE: Remembrance of the Daleks) although according to the Dalek Prime, the Movellan War was a staged hoax. (PROSE: War of the Daleks) Daleks which were engaged in a conflict against humanity travelled back through Earth's history where they conducted the Dalek Project to understand how humans fought. After arriving in the period of the First World War, they were defeated on the Western Front in 1917. The survivors were defeated in 2017. (COMIC: The Dalek Project) In 2019, the recovered casing of the Reconnaissance Dalek led to the creation of the new Defence Drones by 2021. Through cloning, the deceased Dalek was inadvertently resurrected by Leo Rugazzi and cloned an army of its own that took control of the Defence Dalek shells. In order to stop them, the Thirteenth Doctor summoned Death Squad Daleks to Earth, leading to a small-scale civil war between the two Dalek factions. The Death Squad Daleks destroyed the Defence Drone Daleks only to have their Dalek saucer blown up by Captain Jack Harkness, Ryan Sinclair and Graham O'Brien. The Doctor successfully tricked the remaining Daleks into a &quot;spare&quot; TARDIS and sent them into the heart of the Void, destroying them as well. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks) Final Dalek War and beyond Main article: Final Dalek War The Final Dalek War was a hypothesised future conflict, supposedly sparked by &quot;the penultimate destruction of Skaro&quot;. (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors) By the far future, circa 10,000,000, the Daleks were considered a part of the First Segment of Time. (TV: The Ark) According to the Daleks themselves, the &quot;creatures&quot; of 500,000,000 knew nothing of them. (PROSE: I Am a Dalek) Remembrance A highly fictionalised account of the Third Dalek War served as the premise for the low-budget holovid series EarthDoom XV. It aired in Chris Cwej's native time period (PROSE: Sky Pirates!) of the 30th century. (PROSE: Head Games) A Velyshaan museum contained an exhibit on the wars after the Second Great Dalek Occupation. (PROSE: Museum Peace) By the time of humanity's war against the Wall of Noise, the Great War against the Daleks to be ancient history. (AUDIO: The Anachronauts) Behind the scenes The Enigma of the Missing Planet, a feature in Terry Nation's Dalek Annual 1978, speculates that the solar system's missing planet was destroyed in &quot;one of the great Dalek wars&quot;. According to Lance Parkin's Whoniverse: An Unofficial Planet-By-Planet Guide to the Universe of the Doctor, from Gallifrey to Skaro, the script for Into the Dalek specifies that the story takes place in the 31st century. The Dalek Handbook dates the Dalek Wars as taking place between 2540 to circa 3000. The latter date is derived from dialogue in Mission to the Unknown, in which Gordon Lowery claims &quot;the Daleks invaded Earth a thousand years ago&quot; relative to the year 4000. The Handbook therefore postulates that the Wars &quot;ended with a short-lived invasion of Earth followed by a tactical retreat from the Milky Way around the year 3000.&quot; According to A History of the Universe, aHistory, and The Dalek Handbook, the events of Death to the Daleks (the Exxilon Gambit of the Third Dalek War) took place circa 2600. This is reasonably consistent with the known dates of the Second Dalek War, though it may conflict with the 27th century Dalek invasion. In a cut scene from Lance Parkin's earlier novel The Dying Days, the 42nd Doctor described the events of the Final Dalek War to Jason Kane and Iphegenia. During the Final Dalek War, the Children of Kasterborous teamed up with humanity to fight the Daleks in their own territory. Tens of trillions died, and entire galaxies were destroyed, but after countless years of fighting the Daleks were driven to extinction. In their wake, the people of the universe were left united in universal peace.[1] Doctor Who: Battles in Time magazine regularly featured double-page spreads of various Dalek conflicts in a series entitled Dalek Wars. Each bi-weekly instalment, starting from #1 until #59, was accompanied by a short source dealing the events. According to #55, a conflict known as the Third Dalek War was fought between the Daleks and the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire. According to the source, the retreating Daleks attack the planet JT227, the source of the element Promethium 62, utilised by humans are using to break Dalek forcefields. The human' Spindroid mining machines fight back and overpower the Daleks, which are subsequently pushed out of human space. As this involved the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire and not the Earth Empire, it is at odds with in-universe mentions of the Third Dalek War.

                   NS1:content=" Linux 中国 技术 新闻 观点 分享 LCTT 桌面应用 系统运维 软件开发 树莓派 容器与云 区块链 硬核观察 极客漫画 开源智慧 穿山甲专访 开源之道 代码英雄 Linux 发行版 搜索 搜索 ❏ 站外平台： 文本模式 文章 适用于所有发行版的 Linux 应用程序——是否真的有好处呢？ 作者： Liron 译者： LCTT insidentally | 2016-09-21 12:33 评论: 4 让我们回顾一下 Linux 社区最新的愿景——推动去中心化的应用来解决发行版的碎片化。 继上周的文章：“Snap、Flatpak 这种通吃所有发行版的打包方式真的有用吗？” 之后，一系列新观点浮出水面，其中可能包含关于这样应用是否有用的重要信息。 缺点 就这个话题在这里的评论，一个叫 Till 的 Gentoo 使用者，对于上一次我们未能完全解释的问题给出了一些新的观点。 对于上一次我们选择仅仅称之为膨胀的的东西，Till 从另一方面做了剖析膨胀将来的发展，这可以帮助我们更好的理解它的组成和其影响。 这些被称之为“捆绑应用”的应用程序能够工作在所有发行版上的机制是——将它依赖的库都包含在它们的应用软件之中，Till 说： “捆绑应用装载了大量的并不被应用开发者所维护的软件。如果其中的某个函数库被发现了一个安全问题而需要更新的话，你得为每一个独立的应用程序安装更新来确保你的系统安全。” 本质上，Till 提出了一个重要的安全问题。但是它并不仅仅与安全有关系，它还关系到许多方面，比如说系统维护、原子更新等等。 此外，如果我们进一步假设：依赖的开发者们也许会合作，将他们的软件与使用它的应用程序一起发布（一种理想状况），但这将导致整个平台的开发整体放缓。 另一个将会导致的问题是透明的依赖关系变得模糊，就是说，如果你想知道一个应用程序捆绑了哪些依赖关系，你必须依靠开发者发布这些数据。 或者就像 Till 说的：“比如说像某某包是否已经包含了更新的某函数库这样的问题将会是你每天需要面对的。” 与之相反，对于 Linux 现行的标准的包管理方法（包括二进制包和源码包），你能够很容易的注意到哪些函数库已经在系统中更新了。 并且，你也可以很轻松的知道其它哪些应用使用了这个函数库，这就将你从繁琐的单独检查每一个应用程序的工作中解救了出来。 其他可能由膨胀导致的缺点包括：更大的包体积（每一个应用程序捆绑了依赖），更高的内存占用（没有共享函数库），并且，少了一个包过滤机制来防止恶意软件：发行版的包维护者也充当了一个在开发者和用户之间的过滤者，他保障了用户获得高质量的软件。 而在捆绑应用中就不再是这种情况了。 最后一点，Till 声称，尽管在某些情况下很有用，但是在大多数情况下，捆绑应用程序将弱化自由软件在发行版中的地位（专有软件供应商将被能够发布他们的软件而不用把它放到公共软件仓库中）。 除此之外，它引出了许多其他问题。很多问题都可以简单归结到开发人员身上。 优点 相比之下,另一个名叫 Sven 的人的评论试图反驳目前普遍反对使用捆绑应用程序的观点，从而证明和支持使用它。 “浪费空间？”——Sven 声称在当今世界我们有很多其他事情在浪费磁盘空间，比如电影存储在硬盘上、本地安装等等…… 最终，这些事情浪费的空间要远远多于仅仅“ 100 MB 而你每天都要使用的程序。……因此浪费空间的说法实在很荒谬。” “浪费运行内存？”——主要的观点有： 共享库浪费的内存要远远少于程序的运行时数据所占用的。 而今运行内存已经很便宜了。 “安全梦魇”——不是每个应用程序的运行真正的要注重安全。 而且，许多应用程序甚至从来没有过任何安全更新，除非在“滚动更新的发行版”。 除了 Sven 这种从实用出发的观点以外，Till 其实也指出了捆绑应用在一些情况下也有着其优点： 专有软件的供应商想要保持他们的代码游离于公共仓库之外将更加容易。 没有被你的发行版打包进去的小众应用程序将变得更加可行。 在没有 Beta 包的二进制发行版中测试应用将变得简单。 将用户从复杂的依赖关系中解放出来。 最后的思考 虽然关于此问题有着不同的想法，但是有一个被大家共同接受的观点是：捆绑应用对于填补 Linux 生态系统有着其独到的作用。 虽然如此，它的定位，不论是主流的还是边缘的，都变得愈发清晰，至少理论上是这样。 想要尽可能优化其系统的用户，在大多数情况下应该要避免使用捆绑应用。 而讲究易用性、尽可能在维护系统上少费劲的用户，可能应该会感觉这种新应用十分舒爽。 via: http://www.iwillfolo.com/linux-applications-that-works-on-all-distributions-are-they-any-good/ 作者：Editorials 译者：Chao-zhi 校对：wxy 本文由 LCTT 原创翻译，Linux中国 荣誉推出 发表评论 评论 最新评论 发表评论 [1] 来自陕西西安的 Chrome 53.0|GNU/Linux 用户 发表于 2016-09-21 22:17 的评论： 5 赞 回复 看看UNIX的失败。值得Linux思考。 [2] POCMON [QQ Browser 9.4|Windows 10] 发表于 2016-09-22 16:04 的评论： 4 赞 回复 WIN在这方面的成功也值得LINUX思考 来自内蒙古呼和浩特的 Chrome 53.0|Windows 10 用户 2016-09-23 14:03 6 赞 回复 然而linux这么多年了，还在考虑，考虑 朩ダo○ [Firefox 48.0|Windows 7] 2016-09-22 09:44 5 赞 回复 很简单，两种方式并行就可以咯。然后不同的用户可以选择不同的方式，或者说不同类型的用户可以在自己的电脑上以不同比例使用两种方式来安装这种软件。又或者对不同类型的软件使用不同的方式，常用的，使用包依赖的方式安装，不常用或偶尔用的或者昂贵的版权类的软件，可以使用捆绑式安装方式。 译自：iwillfolo.com 作者： Liron 原创：LCTT https://linux.cn/article-7796-1.html 译者： insidentally 本文由 LCTT 原创翻译，Linux 中国首发。也想加入译者行列，为开源做一些自己的贡献么？欢迎加入 LCTT！ 翻译工作和译文发表仅用于学习和交流目的，翻译工作遵照 CC-BY-SA 协议规定，如果我们的工作有侵犯到您的权益，请及时联系我们。 欢迎遵照 CC-BY-SA 协议规定 转载，敬请在正文中标注并保留原文/译文链接和作者/译者等信息。 文章仅代表作者的知识和看法，如有不同观点，请楼下排队吐槽 :D 上一篇：Linus Torvalds 透露他编程最喜欢使用的笔记本下一篇：是时候合并 LibreOffice 和 OpenOffice 了 LCTT 译者 insidentally 🌟🌟🌟🌟 共计翻译： 36.0 篇 | 共计贡献： 2376 天 贡献时间：2016-09-11 -&gt; 2023-03-15 访问我的 LCTT 主页 | 在 GitHub 上关注我 相关阅读 软件包 snap Flatpak 2016-09-17Snap、Flatpak 这种通吃所有发行版的打包方式真的有用吗？ 2016-06-24下一代独立式 GNU/Linux 应用打包格式 Flatpak 发布 2016-06-25Canonical 并不指望别的发行版也从 Ubuntu 商店下载 Snap 软件包 2022-04-17Ubuntu 的前 Snap 倡导者创建了一个工具，帮助你从 Snap 迁移到 Flatpak 2022-09-06如何成为专业的 Flatpak 用户 Linux 中国 © 2003 - 2022 京ICP备2021020457 京公网安备110105001595 服务条款 | 除特别申明外，本站原创内容版权遵循 CC-BY-SA 协议规定 返回顶部 分享到微信 打开微信，点击顶部的“╋”， 使用“扫一扫”将网页分享至微信。 " />

BSG VS BSG) 6.20 Battlestar Galactica: Twilight Command 7 Tokyopop 8 References Marvel Comics Marvel Comics began its adaptation of Galactica with Super Special 8. Super Special was a magazine format comic book that featured different characters or adaptations each month. Issue 8 was produced just in time for the launch of the TV series in September 1978. Marvel Comics Series - Issue 2 The Super Special adaptation was derived from an interim script of &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;, and some of the differences in the story are evident. This adaptation was also released in a tabloid format by both Marvel Comics and Whitman Comics. Spurred on by the success of this adaptation, Marvel began a monthly comic series that ran from 1978 through 1980, and lasted a total of 23 issues. The first three issues, titled Battlestar Galactica, Exodus! and Deathtrap! respectively, consisted of a longer adaptation of Saga of a Star World, taking much of the art from the Super Special adaptation and expanding it by several pages. The adaptation of the series continued in next two issues entitled Into the Void and A Death in the Family, which chronicled the story from the two part television episode &quot;Lost Planet of the Gods&quot;. Beginning with The Memory Machine, Marvel began publishing all new stories based on the characters in the series. From this point, the story began to depart from what was depicted in the series. According to letters pages within the publication, Marvel's contract with Universal Studios specifically did not allow them to use anything from the television series that followed &quot;Lost Planet Of The Gods&quot;. In the storyline that unfolded, a good deal of the comic took place in the magnetic void which the fleet first encountered in the TV episode &quot;Lost Planet of the Gods&quot;. In the end of the TV episode, the fleet moves back into normal space, leaving the void behind, but in the comics the rag tag fleet remains in the void beginning in issue #4, with the fleet finally returning to regular space in issue #14. (This makes placing the episodes within the span of the TV series difficult, since much of the action could be surmised to have taken place between &quot;Lost Planet of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Lost Warrior&quot;.) In terms of tone, many of the Marvel comics had horror elements, a theme that was visited sparingly in the TV series. An incomplete list of monsters from the comic series would include a space vampire (issue #9), a carnivorous planet (issue #10), alien vermin (issue #15), a crewmember who transforms into a red ape (issues #17 and #18) and a monstrous shapeshifter (issue #21). Even the menacing and relentless Cylon Mark III in issue #16 owes as much of his origin to horror elements as he does to science fiction. Taken as a whole, Marvel’s Galactica is somewhat darker in tone than the series, but this not-so-subtle paranoia is arguable truer to the initial premise of the series than were some of the latter episodes of the television program. Notably, the writers of Galactica comic were quite willing to remove key characters from the dramatic mix for periods of time. From issues #6 to #12, Commander Adama is placed within a machine to help him remember the ancient writings he briefly saw on Kobol and, although we do spend some time in his dreams, he is effectively removed from commanding Galactica for several issues, which of course sets up its own dramatic tension. Another character who leaves the series for awhile is Starbuck, as part of perhaps the most effective story arc in the series. In this plotline the fleet stumbles upon Scavenger World, the dominion of the female space pirate Eurayle, who makes a deal to spare the Colonials if she can keep Starbuck at her side. The interactions between Starbuck and Eurayle are memorable, and the conclusion of the storyline, with a tremendous battle in issue #13, is a satisfying conclusion. At the end of the tale, Starbuck remains with Eurayle, and the fleet moves on without him, which of course sets us up for his triumphant return in issues #19 and #20. Unlike both television series, Galactica comic actually had a planned ending, with a series of plot devices being wound up in the final two part story of issues #22 and #23. In the course of solving a mystery, Lieutenant Jolly finds adventure and romance and helps in figuring out the long sought coordinates for Earth. A tongue in cheek adventure ably drawn and scripted by Walt Simonson this plotline provided a strong end for a memorable series.

Differences from the Televised Pilot Baltar is executed by the Cylons. Lyra (Serina) is told that she is dying from radiation sickness. Cassiopeia does not survive the Ovion mines. In the final scene, Lyra says good-bye to Apollo. Titan Books Marvel reprints - trade paperbacks Saga of a Star World by Roger McKenzie, Ernie Colon and Walt Simonson The Memory Machine by Roger McKenzie, Klaus Janson, Walt Simonson and Tom DeFalco Look-In Magazine Look-In Magazine, a UK based publication for children, published a serialized comic strip featuring Galactica from October 20, 1979 through October 11, 1980. The four untitled storylines spanned 52 issues, and contained 13 two page chapters per storyline. A very solid composition throughout, this incarnation of the rag tag fleet has been largely overlooked.[1] Storyline 1 (issues 1979 #43 to 1980 #3) Storyline 2 (issues 1980 #4 to 1980 #16) Storyline 3 (issues 1980 #17 to 1980 #29) Storyline 4 (issues 1980 #30 to 1980 #42) Grandreams Annuals The UK company Grandreams came out with two Battlestar Galactica hardcover annuals, which contained short text and comic book stories. Far inferior to the Look-In strips, these comics were aimed primarily at children.

Finally, in July of 1995, Maximum Press (a Rob Liefeld imprint) published a miniseries that continued Galactica mythos, and ignored the storyline from Galactica 1980. This miniseries is also known as the War of Eden. This series was popular enough that it encouraged Maximum to keep going, and soon more miniseries appeared. Apollo’s Journey, The Enemy Within, and Starbuck all published as three issue series in 1995 through early 1996. Journey’s End, the final four issue series, broke many Galactica conventions. For example, there is a depiction of Galactica traveling back through time back to the destruction of the Colonies. This was not to last, however, and after the publishing of a compendium volume in early 1997, Maximum announced it would cease publishing comics based on Battlestar Galactica.

Other one shots were subsequently published. Later, Realm introduced a monthly comic titled Battlestar Galactica Season 3. This series only ran for three issues before it was canceled, and shortly thereafter Realm abandoned the project altogether. The Realm series was notable for its use of airbrushed art and its attempts to remain faithful to the look and feel of the Original Series.

The comics are set within the framework of the show and, at at first were set between the episodes &quot;Home, Part II&quot; and &quot;Pegasus&quot;. Beginning in late September 2006 Dynamite began releasing an Original Series continuation series. In October 2006, a miniseries focusing on the Re-imagined Series character Tom Zarek was released, focusing on Zarek's past. In September 2009, a miniseries focusing on a &quot;re-imagined&quot; Galactica 1980 was released. A sequel was scheduled to be released in 2012 written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, jumping it 33 years later[2], but the series never materialized. Instead, Abnett and Lanning began work on what would be known as the 35th anniversary comic run based on the Original Series (with some 1980 elements), entitled Classic Battlestar Galactica Vol. 2. Re-imagined Series Re-imagined Battlestar Galactica Issue 8 The first series of issues based on the Re-imagined Series written by Greg Pak and pencilled by Nigel Raynor.

BSG VS BSG) In 2018, science fiction author Peter David wrote a five issue tale entitled Battlestar Galactica vs. Battlestar Galactica depicting a crossover between the two disparate versions to celebrate their different anniversaries: the 40th anniversary of the original 1978 series and the 15th anniversary of the 2003 series developed by Ronald D. Moore. The six issue series, outside of the obvious fantastical nature, feature a plethora of visual incongruities and detail deficiencies relating to both series over its limited run.

The line launched to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman (1989—1996) and Vertigo's 25th anniversary. The Sandman Universe began in August 2018, with a titular one-shot, which was followed by four ongoing series—House of Whispers, Lucifer, The Books of Magic, and The Dreaming. Each comic is overseen by Gaiman but written by new creative teams. The Sandman Universe Publication information Publisher DC Comics DC Vertigo (2018–2019) DC Black Label (2019–present) Genre Dark fantasy Publication date August 2018 Main character(s) Dream Lucien Matthew Cable Lucifer Dora Timothy Hunter Erzulie John Constantine Contents 1 Conception and development 2 Titles 3 Collected editions 4 Reception 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links Conception and developmentEdit The Sandman Universe celebrates the 30th anniversary of DC Comics' The Sandman[1] and the 25th anniversary of the launch of the DC Vertigo imprint. The line was conceived and is overseen by the series' creator, Neil Gaiman, but produced by new creative teams. The Sandman Universe expands The Sandman's part of the DC Universe[2] using new characters and concepts.[3] The line was announced by Entertainment Weekly in March 2018 and was accompanied by a trailer featuring Gaiman. It launched with the one-shot The Sandman Universe #1 on August 8, 2018, with the other series following on later dates.[3] When asked why he returned to The Sandman, Gaiman said he began to feel guilty that almost no one had been able to return to the series since its conclusion and liked the idea of reviving it, as well as letting new writers play with his &quot;toys&quot;. Gaiman assembled the writing team for the line with the Vertigo editorial team. Both parties suggested writers who they thought would be good for new Sandman stories. Samples by writers were then read by Gaiman, who decided whether or not they were proficient. Deciding writers also involved choosing which comic suited which writer best; Gaiman cited Nalo Hopkinson's science fiction work as an influence for assigning her to House of Whispers. Gaiman chose Kat Howard, who he has worked with for several years, to reboot The Books of Magic because of her handling of magic in her stories, and Dan Watters to write Lucifer because he was up to the challenge of recreating the character.[3] TitlesEdit The Sandman Universe began with a titular one-shot released in August 2018. It picks up after the events of DC's 2017–2018 Dark Nights: Metal crossover event. Dream has disappeared since the conclusion of Metal,[4] leading to chaos in his homeland of the Dreaming. Each Sandman Universe series follows a story thread introduced in the one-shot.[1][3][2] Title Issues Writer(s) Artist(s) Publication date Format Year One The Sandman Universe #1 Simon Spurrier, Kat Howard, Nalo Hopkinson, Dan Watters Bilquis Evely, Tom Fowler, Dominike Stanton, Max Fiumara, Sebastian Fiumara August 2018 One-shot The Dreaming #1–20 Simon Spurrier Bilquis Evely September 2018 – April 2020 Monthly ongoing House of Whispers #1–22 Nalo Hopkinson Dominike Stanton September 2018 – June 2020 Monthly ongoing Lucifer #1–24[a] Dan Watters Max Fiumara and Sebastian Fiumara October 2018 – Monthly ongoing The Books of Magic #1–23 Kat Howard Tom Fowler October 2018 – September 2020 Monthly ongoing Year Two The Sandman Universe Presents: Hellblazer #1 Simon Spurrier Marcio Takara October 2019 One-shot John Constantine, Hellblazer #1–12 Aaron Campbell November 2019 – November 2020 Monthly ongoing The Dreaming: Waking Hours #1– G.

                   NS1:content=" The Best Star Trek Books (for the 50th Anniversary) Kristen McQuinn Sep 6, 2016 This content contains affiliate links. When you buy through these links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I have a confession to make. I am a hard core, died in the wool, unapologetic Trekkie. These are the best Star Trek books that bridged my love of the show and reading. I can’t remember a time when Star Trek wasn’t a part of my life. This year is the 50th anniversary of the series, which aired for the first time on September 8, 1966, so there are a LOT of people who can probably say they also grew up with it. I grew up watching episodes of The Original Series in syndication. I was nine when The Next Generation began, and I never missed a single episode. To this day, I can tell you what season an episode is from based just on the style of the uniform Captain Picard is wearing. I even have a sizable amount of memory devoted to being able to tell which episode is playing, complete with episode title and full plot synopsis, based on a five second clip. I can do the same with Voyager. Try not to be jealous. I have seen every episode of Deep Space Nine as well, although I came to its fandom later, so I didn’t devote as much time to my rabid fanaticism and, alas, can’t tell you quite as much about it. I’ve since decided that further study is required! The Dominion War was crazy, y’all! I might joke about being a nerdy Trekkie, but truthfully, the Star Trek fan base is one of its greatest strengths. The Original Series was a relatively unsuccessful show in its initial airing, but eventually we got The Next Generation approved, and that lasted seven seasons. Scientists who are also Trekkies were inspired to make things like cell phones, laptops, tablets, and Skype based on things they saw on various episodes of the show. And we howled and initiated a massive letter writing campaign that resulted in us talking NASA into naming a shuttle after our starship. They say it is named after an aircraft carrier. Uh-huh. Sure it is. We all know better. Star Trek is pretty unusual in that it is very supportive of fan-driven creative works as well. Many other fandoms are indifferent to fan creations, or worse, actively discourage them, citing legalese bullshit. Star Trek, on the other hand, has always actively encouraged fandom. In addition to the usual fanfiction and such surrounding any kind of fandom, there have been many official contests sanctioned by The Powers That Be (TPTB), much to the delight of the fans. Fan artists competed for the chance to design the starship Titan, William Riker’s ship when he left the Enterprise to take on his own command. Other fan artists also create the Ships of the Line calendar each year. There are fan films, some of them rivaling the quality of actual episodes, in my opinion. We’ve gotten multiple fanfiction contests in the form of the Strange New Worlds anthologies, comprised entirely of amateur short stories written by fans. I don’t know of any other fandom that allows its fans to do that in an official capacity. TPTB let us play in the sandbox with their characters and don’t make fun of us for wanting to. They let us have fun. We get to explore other stories that weren’t done on the screen. Basically, the Star Trek TPTB rock. Naturally, my love of all things Trek extends to the novel franchise as well. Many of the best Star Trek books go into depth with a variety of social issues, just as the episodes do, and many go in entirely new directions. As with all publishing, Star Trek isn’t immune from needing a huge injection of diversity in their ranks, as their authors are incredibly white and male in general. There are a few women writing Trek novels, but generally speaking, sci-fi, including Star Trek, is really whitewashed. Maybe, hopefully, we will see an increase in both women and people of color writing in the genre. Honestly, come on, TPTB. Get with it. It would be in the finest tradition of the Federation to embrace diversity a lot more. The Best Star Trek Books This is by no means a comprehensive list of Star Trek books. There are hundreds of novels and I wish I could just put them all here. But I can’t, so instead I listed a few of the best Star Trek books from each series that I personally like for one reason or another. I truly hope you enjoy it. Want to revel a bit more in Star Trek bookishness? Check out our post on the best literary Star Trek moments! Read long and prosper, friends! Nonfiction Star Trek Books Federation: The First 150 Years, David A. Goodman This is the history of the first 150 years of the United Federation of Planets. The Star Trek Encyclopedia, Michael and Denise Okuda A newly revised, 2-book set is to be released on October 18, 2016 with about 300 pages of new and expanded entries, up to and including Into Darkness. YES. The Star Trek Cookbook, Ethan Phillips and William J. Birnes Some genuinely great recipes, many volunteered from the cast and crew themselves, and doctored up to sound more Trekish. Jeri Ryan’s wild mushroom soup is one of my very favorite recipes ever now and I make it often. Living with Star Trek: American Culture and the Star Trek Universe, Lincoln Geraghty A great discussion on the influence of Star Trek on American society at various levels. The Physics of Star Trek, Lawrence Krauss Real science, by a real scientist! The Best Star Trek Books: The Original Series Star Trek: The Classic Episodes (Barnes and Noble classics edition) A very pretty hardbound book which includes several novelizations of the most popular episodes of The Original Series, including “The Menagerie,” “A Taste of Armageddon,” “The City on the Edge of Forever,” and “The Trouble with Tribbles.” Star Trek Academy: Collision Course, William Shatner I’m a huge sucker for back stories. This novel shows us the backstory of how Kirk and Spock met and became friends at Starfleet Academy. The Kobayashi Maru, Julia Ecklar Back stories! Dreaded no-win scenarios! Sign me up. Black Fire, Sonni Cooper Spock turns into some kind of space pirate. It’s fun, just go with it. Shadow Lord, Lawrence Yep Sulu is the star! The Best Star Trek Books: The Next Generation Gulliver’s Fugitives, Keith Sharee A lost Earth colony where imagination and freedom of thought are crimes. Pairs well with modern American politics… Imzadi, Peter David One of my all time favorite Trek novels ever OMG. Riker and Troi’s entire back story, and you know I love me a good back story! Plus, Peter David is considered one of the greats of Trek authors. His novels are universally funny, action packed, and always amazing. The Death of Princes, John Peel I’m also a sucker for books about diseases and plagues. This is disease and violations of the Prime Directive all in one book. Double Helix six-book miniseries, John Gregory Betancourt, Dean Wesley Smith &amp; Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Diane Carey, John Vorholt, Peter David, and Michael Jan Friedman &amp; Christie Golden This miniseries that incorporates back stories AND disease things rings all my bells! Section 31: Rogue, Andy Mangels &amp; Michael A. Martin Even Starfleet has its dark underbelly. Articles of the Federation, Keith R.A. DeCandido A novel that highlights the politics and administration of the Federation. Destiny trilogy, David Mack HOLY SHIT, THE BORG AND GENOCIDAL RAGE AND JUST FUCKING READ IT! The Sky’s the Limit anthology, ed. by Marco Palmieri Fantastic short story collection set during the years of TNG. The Best Star Trek Books: Deep Space Nine Fallen Heroes, Daffyd ab Hugh The first DS9 novel I ever read. It was action packed and sad and made me fall in love with the characters. This made me a DS9 fan every bit as much as the show itself. The Lives of Dax, ed. Marco Palmieri I may have mentioned I’m a big fan of back stories? Yeah, this gives you ALL the back stories of Dax! What’s not to love? A Stitch in Time, Andrew J. Robinson Elim Garak. That is all I needed to know. Section 31: Disavowed, David Mack More with the seedy underside of Starfleet, plus Julian Bashir. The Best Star Trek Books: Voyager Pathways and Mosaic, Jeri Taylor Back stories! Pathways tells the stories of all of the Voyager crew, and Mosaic tells Captain Janeway’s story specifically. Seven of Nine, Christie Golden More back story, this time on the Borg drone who Capt. Janeway liberated from the Collective and who has since become one of my very favorite characters. Death of a Neutron Star, Eric Kotani I liked this book because it is written by a real scientist. Eric Kotani is the pseudonym for Yoji Kando, a Japanese astrophysicist. Distant Shores, ed. Marco Palmieri A delightful collection of short stories set on the voyage home. The Best Star Trek Books: Enterprise Surak’s Soul, JM Dillard I dig the Vulcans, their logic, and their stoicism, so any book about a Vulcan having an ethical or existential crisis really lights my fire. Star Trek Anthologies And Crossovers Tales from the Captain’s Table anthology, ed. by Keith R.A. DeCandido Every star system has a bar called The Captain’s Table, where the first round is paid for with a story… Tales of the Dominion War, Keith R.A. DeCandido A short story collection that tells the tales of the various ways in which the Dominion War impacted all the characters we’ve come to know and love, and a few we can’t stand but want to know about anyway. Strange New Worlds volumes 1-10, plus the new one coming out for the 50th anniversary this year These are great because fans get to write fanfiction and get published, for reals, and it’s so rad. Also, yours truly was selected to be included in the anthology for the 50th anniversary, so naturally I think that one is awesome! Federation, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens Technically this is listed as a TNG novel, but it has Kirk and Zephram Cochrane and Picard all in one book, so I’m counting it as a crossover. And it’s everything the movie Generations should have been. " />

These accounts seem impossible to reconcile. However, TV: World Enough and Time and The Doctor Falls establish that Cybermen are subject to Parallel Evolution, explaining contradictory sources of their origins. For more information, consult Creation of the Cybermen. Appearance[edit | edit source] The original Cyberman of Mondas, which the Twelfth Doctor identifies on sight as a &quot;Mondasian Cyberman&quot; (TV: World Enough and Time) first appear in TV: The Tenth Planet (1966), set in 1986. These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;CyberMondasian&quot;. A second Cyberman look debuts in TV: The Moonbase (1967), set in 2070. They are later seen on Telos in The Tomb of the Cybermen. These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;CyberTelosian&quot;. A third Cyberman look debuts in TV: The Wheel in Space (1968), set in 2079. These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;Late CyberFaction&quot;. A fourth Cyberman look debuts in TV: The Invasion (1969); set prior to The Tenth Planet, these Cybermen are led by a Cyber-Planner who recognises the Doctor from Planet 14. These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;Early CyberFaction&quot;. A fifth Cyberman look debuts in TV: Revenge of the Cybermen (1975), where they are reeling from their defeat in &quot;the Cyber-War&quot;. These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;CyberNomad&quot;. A sixth Cyberman look, the last of the classic series, debuts in TV: Earthshock (1982); set in the year 2526, the Cybermen fail to stop a conference which will lead to a war they know that cannot win. These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;CyberNeomorph&quot;. A variant of &quot;CyberNeomorph&quot; features in TV: Silver Nemesis (1988). These Cybermen are identified in The ArcHive Tapes as &quot;CyberIsomorph&quot;. The first Cyberman look of the new series is introduced in TV: Rise of the Cybermen (2006) as a product of Cybus Industries from a parallel Earth. With the Cybus logo on their chest plate, such Cybermen appear to be a space-faring power, while making a reference to multiple universes, in TV: The Pandorica Opens; meanwhile, however, near-identical Cyberman appear in GAME: Blood of the Cybermen (2010), distinguished by an engraving of a Cyberman face in place of the Cybus plate. TV: A Good Man Goes to War (2011) marks the on-screen debut of a &quot;Cybus&quot; variant that is a space-faring power within our universe, organised into Cyber Legions; the &quot;Cybus&quot; logo is absent, replaced by a generic chest plate rather than the engraving from Blood of the Cybermen. The second Cyberman look of the new series is introduced in TV: Nightmare in Silver (2013) following the &quot;Cyber-Wars&quot; in the far future. They are associated with the Cyberiad. Mondasian[edit | edit source] Origins[edit | edit source] Ancient Mondas[edit | edit source] COMIC: The Dead Heart COMIC: The Flesh Unbound COMIC: The Black Sky COMIC: The Hungry Sea COMIC: The Dark Flame COMIC: The Future Perfect Later Mondas[edit | edit source] COMIC: The Ugly Underneath Over 2,000 years after The Future Perfect, Mondas breaks from its orbit. At this time, the first modern Cybermen are created. TV: World Enough and Time / The Doctor Falls / PROSE: Jorj / PROSE: Alit in Underland A Mondasian colony ship becomes trapped in the orbit of a black hole, while the inhabitants are gradually cyber-converted. As a result of time dilation, the Cybermen rapidly evolve from the original patients to primitive &quot;Mondasians&quot;, Cybus-style and ultimately Cyberiad-style Cybermen. Spending the last 491 years of his life aboard the ship, Nardole ensures that the remaining Mondasian colonists &quot;sort&quot; their conflict with the Cybermen. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time) AUDIO: Spare Parts In a parallel event, Cybermen also arise on Mondas, a planet which at this stage only has a few thousand inhabitants. COMIC: The Prodigal Returns Following its seperation from Earth, the Cybermen rule Mondas. Early invasions[edit | edit source] 1873 - AUDIO: The Silver Turk At this point, Mondas is 200 light years away from Earth. A Mondasian Cyberman scout sent to find Earth crash lands on the planet but fails to report its location. In 1879, a Cybermat appears at Winston Churchill's 5th birthday party. It is smashed by the Fourth Doctor. (PROSE: The Lost Diaries of Winston Spencer Churchill) 1954 - COMIC: The Good Soldier The Seventh Doctor and Ace delay the Mondasian Cybermen's attack on Earth. 22 November 1963 - COMIC: Prologue: The First Doctor In the alternate timeline which is ultimately reversed by the Twelfth Doctor and Rassilon, the CyberMondasians appear on Earth where they capture the First Doctor, interrupting the events of An Unearthly Child. 1970 - COMIC: Cyber-Mole The Second Doctor and his grandchildren thwart an attempt by the Mondasian Cybermen take over Earth using a Cyber-Mole. COMIC: Test Flight The Mondasian Cybermen attempt to hijack an American B-52 bomber but are defeated by the Second Doctor. 1976 (projection) - PROSE: No Future TV: The Invasion Subject to UNIT dating but roughly between c.1969 and c.1979. The early CyberFaction, led by a Cyber-Planner who recognises the Second Doctor and Jamie McCrimmon from Planet 14, invade Earth but are destroyed by UNIT. This is the first invasion of Earth recorded by both the Faction's history computer and the independent ArcHive. AUDIO: The Isos Network Shortly following The Invasion, a Cyber-Controller, identical to the one later seen in The Tomb of the Cybermen, leads the Cybermen in a second attempt to invade Earth, from Isos II, but they are destroyed by the Second Doctor and his companions. AUDIO: The Blue Tooth During the former's exile on Earth, the Third Doctor and Liz Shaw encounter a ship of Cybermen. COMIC: Prologue: The Third Doctor In the alternate timeline which is ultimately reversed by the Twelfth Doctor and Rassilon, a time distortion interrupts one of the many battles between the Earth-bound Third Doctor and the Master, converting the latter into a CyberNomad. PROSE: The Piper The Third Doctor and Jo Grant stop a Cyberman leftover from The Invasion. 1984 - AUDIO: The Reaping The Sixth Doctor briefly meets a Cyberman on Mondas. As Hegelia suggests, the early CyberFaction, still based on the dark side of the Moon, are contacted by future CyberNeomorphs or &quot;CyberIsomorphs&quot;. Having already failed to change history by destroying Earth in 1985, the Neomorphs convince their ancestors not to interfere in the coming Mondasian invasion and instead move to the asteroid belt. The Isomorphs themselves remain on the Moon and are apparently all destroyed in 1988. (AUDIO: The Ultimate Cybermen) COMIC: Flower Power The Second Doctor and his grandchildren fight the Mondasian Cybermen who, led by a Cyber-Controller, have established a Cyber-City on an unidentified planet. These Cybermen fail to recognise the Second Doctor and his companions. COMIC: The Cyber Empire The Mondasian Cyber-Empire is at its height. The Cybermen capture thousands of Earthmen to build a Cyber-City in honour of the Cyber-Controller, who now sports a cape. The Second Doctor and his grandchildren topple the city and enable the humans to return home. COMIC: The Coming of the Cybermen The Second Doctor and his grandchildren thwart a plot by the Mondasian Cybermen to destroy Earth with a bomb. The Cybermen mistake the Doctor for an Earthling. PROSE: The Mondas Crystals Leads directly into The Tenth Planet from the Cybermen's perspective. 1986 - TV: The Tenth Planet/PROSE: Doctor Who and the Tenth Planet Mondas, where the Cyber-Controller resides, returns to the solar system. The CyberMondasians launch a failed invasion of Earth which ends with the destruction of Mondas. This is the second invasion of Earth recorded by both the Faction's history computer and the independent ArcHive. The encounter with the First Doctor is recalled by the Neomorphs in Earthshock. Lying low[edit | edit source] Around the year 1990 by Hegelia's reckoning, the CyberNomads' begin a two century period of proliferation throughout Mutter's Spiral. (AUDIO: The Cyber Nomads) 1993 (alternate timeline) - COMIC: Time &amp; Time Again 1990s- PROSE: Scientific Adviser The Cybermen have been driven from Planet 14. 2000 - PROSE: Vrs An unidentified Cyber-group unleashes a computer virus. 2006 - AUDIO: Human Resources The survivors of The Tenth Planet have settled on Lonsis, however they are depicted as the Cybermen from The Invasion. They have never heard of Telos and know only of the Doctor from their meeting in The Tenth Planet 2006 - COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen In the alternate timeline which is ultimately reversed by the Twelfth Doctor and Rassilon, the Cybermen succeed in conquering Earth. 2006, November - PROSE: Iceberg The survivors of The Invasion plan a second invasion. 4 May 2010 - GAME: Blood of the Cybermen A ship of Cybermen, identical to Pete's World but with an engraved Cyber face in place of the Cybus brand, had been caught in a time storm and crashed in the Arctic ten thousand years prior. Converting a human expedition into Cyberslaves, they are destroyed following a confrontation with the Eleventh Doctor. 2011 - TV: Closing Time The Eleventh Doctor finds a Cyber Legion ship has crashed on Earth &quot;centuries ago&quot;. Intending to convert Earth, the surviving Cybermen only manage to upgrade several humans before they are destroyed. 2012 - GAME: The Eternity Clock The Ninth Cyber Legion invade London but are destroyed by the Eleventh Doctor. This event is possibly the same as the later mentioned Cybermen invasion of 2012. 2013 - COMIC: The Doctor and the Nurse Cybus-style Cybermen surround the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS at Roald Dahl Plass in Cardiff. 2014 - TV: Dark Water/Death in Heaven The Twelfth Doctor finds an army of Nightmare in Silver Cybermen created by Missy, who intends to upgrade the Earth. However, converted Danny Pink leads the Cybermen in destroying themselves; soon after, the converted Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart seemingly kills Missy before leaving to parts unknown. c. 2015 - TV: Face the Raven A single Nightmare in Silver Cyberman, possibly Lethbridge-Stewart, is a resident of the Trap Street, London. 2021 - AUDIO: The Harvest Continued conquests[edit | edit source] 15 October 2070 - TV: The Moonbase/PROSE: Doctor Who and the Cybermen The Second Doctor thwarts a plot by CyberTelosians to use the Graviton to destroy all life on Earth from the Moon. These Cybermen identify as descendants of the first space travellers from Mondas and represent a &quot;Cyberman Empire&quot;. At this point, humans believe the Cybermen to have died out years ago. (AUDIO: The Early Cybermen) COMIC: Prologue: The Second Doctor In the alternate timeline which is ultimately reversed by the Twelfth Doctor and Rassilon, the CyberTelosians successfully upgrade the Second Doctor. COMIC: Masquerade The Second Doctor, accompanied by his grandchildren, infiltrates the Mondasian Cybermen, based at a Cyber Out-post on an unidentified planet. COMIC: Eskimo Joe The Second Doctor fights the Mondasian Cybermen on an unidentified planet with Joe. These Cybermen have a Cyber-Empire and recognise the Doctor. 2079 - TV: The Wheel in Space The Cybermen are of the &quot;late CyberFaction&quot;. The encounter with the Second Doctor is recalled in Earthshock. AUDIO: Legend of the Cybermen The Cybermen launch a second attack on the Wheel, but are pulled into the Land of Fiction. 2114 - PROSE: Status Update Cyberiad Cybermen launch a failed invasion of the human colony world of Tiestus. COMIC: The Time Museum The Second Doctor and his grandchildren elude the Mondasian Cybermen in a Time Museum with exhibits up to 2150. COMIC: The Champion The Second Doctor, accompanied by his grandchildren, engages a Mondasian Cyberman in an arena operated by a race who capture time travellers. PROSE: The Janus Conjunction Occurs some time during the second half of the 22nd century. Around the year 2190 by Hegelia's reckoning, the CyberNomads' period of proliferation ends. (AUDIO: The Cyber Nomads) 2191 - PROSE: Killing Ground The CyberNomads have recently fought the Vogan War. 2267 - COMIC: Assimilation² CyberNomads make an incursion into the Federation universe but are thwarted by the Fourth Doctor. 2284 - AUDIO: The Tyrants of Logic COMIC: Dreadnought Dated 23rd century 2368 - COMIC: Assimilation² Cybus-style Cybermen attempt to combine the Doctor's universe with the Federation universe.

End of the 25th century - TV: The Tomb of the Cybermen The Cybermen have been assumed extinct for five centuries. End of the 25th century - TV: Revenge of the Cybermen Following their defeat in the Cyber-War, the Cybermen are believed by some to have died out. A CyberNomad ship attempts to destroy Voga is thwarted by the Fourth Doctor, resulting in their own destruction. As hypothesised by Hegelia, another group of CyberNomads come across Telos and revive the CyberTelosians. Combining their respective Cyber-technology, the two groups of Cybermen form a new Cyber-subspecies, the CyberNeomorphs, who proliferate throughout the 26th century. (AUDIO: The Cyber Nomads, PROSE: Killing Ground) The Orion War[edit | edit source] 2503 - AUDIO: Sword of Orion AUDIO: Kingdom of Silver Occurs light years from the Orion War front lines. According to one account, Telos is destroyed by an asteroid impact in the early 26th century. (AUDIO: Telos) c. 2515 - AUDIO: Scorpius Occurs &quot;over twenty years&quot; into the Orion War, which began in 2495. AUDIO: Fear AUDIO: Conversion AUDIO: Telos AUDIO: Outsiders AUDIO: Terror AUDIO: Machines AUDIO: Extinction 26th century war[edit | edit source] 2526 - TV: Earthshock Thanks to the Fifth Doctor, the Cybermen fail to stop a conference on Earth which they predict will unite powers against them in a war they will not be able to win. The Cyber-Leader recalls the Doctor's involvement in the events of The Tenth Planet, The Wheel in Space and Revenge of the Cybermen; he is unfamiliar with the Fifth Doctor, only recognising him through the presence of the TARDIS. 26th century - TV: Attack of the Cybermen (Telos scenes) According to Hegelia, Attack of the Cybermen takes place after Earthshock. The Cybermen attempt to leave Telos but are defeated by the Sixth Doctor, who destroys the Cyber-Controller. (AUDIO: The Ultimate Cybermen) Neomorphs in the past[edit | edit source] 1985 - TV: Attack of the Cybermen (Earth scenes) As the Cybermen attempt to leave Telos in the 26th century, other CyberNeomorphs are planted on Earth. Their aim is to use Halley's Comet comet to destroy the Earth of 1985, thus preventing the destruction of Mondas 1986. However, the plot is thwarted by the Sixth Doctor. (AUDIO: The Ultimate Cybermen) As Hegelia suggests, the defeated CyberNeomorphs abandon their base in the London sewers and fall back to the dark side of the Moon, where the early CyberFaction are. Convincing their ancestors to leave the Moon for the asteroid belt, the Neomorphs remain and observe events on Earth. Subtlely changing their form, the Neomorphs become what Hegelia dubs as &quot;CyberIsomorphs&quot;, being isolated from their home time. (AUDIO: The Ultimate Cybermen) 1988 - TV: Silver Nemesis The &quot;CyberIsomorphs&quot; attempt to turn Earth into the New Mondas but are defeated by the Seventh Doctor, who destroys their Cyber-Fleet, apparently vanquishing this Cyber-subspecies. (AUDIO: The Ultimate Cybermen) 1992 - AUDIO: Hour of the Cybermen Dated to 1992 by Warlock's Cross. The Cybermen are Neomorphs. Back to the future[edit | edit source] 26th century - PROSE: Heliotrope Bouquet 2604 - AUDIO: Silver Lining Dated by AHistory. 2606 - AUDIO: The Crystal of Cantus Dated by AHistory. Late 27th century - AUDIO: Return to Telos Set a couple of centuries after The Tomb of the Cybermen to the best of the Fourth Doctor's knowledge.

As recalled by the Ninth Doctor, the Cyber-Empire annexed Malleon in either the 5300s or the 5310s. Again to the best of the Doctor's knowledge, he is in the year 5324 or 5325 as he witnesses the Cybermen ravage Nomicae. Later history[edit | edit source] COMIC: The Flood Highly advanced Cybermen, still unable to convert non-humans, travel back in time to 2005, where they attempt to convert Earth. They are destroyed by the Eighth Doctor. COMIC: Kane's Story In the 82nd century, the Cyber-Empire is led by the Cyber-Emperor. It is &quot;demolished&quot; during the Skeletoid invasion of Mutter's Spiral. The Cybermen are depicted as CyberNeomorphs. The Last Cybermen[edit | edit source] WC: 14683 UNIT Field Log A Cyber-Warrior emerges through the Time Fracture to Earth in 2020. TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati Following the Cyber-War, the Cyber-Empire is in ruins. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon) The lone Cyberman, resembling a Cyberiad Cyberman, pursues and ultimately reclaims the Cyberium from Earth in 1816 before returning to the future with the Thirteenth Doctor and Team TARDIS in pursuit. TV: Ascension of the Cybermen In the immediate aftermath of the Cyber-Wars, both humanity and the Cybermen have been nearly wiped out. As surviving humans attempt to flee from the Cybermen, the lone Cyberman returns to this time with the Cyberium and, joined by Cyber Legion models, discovers a Cyber-Army of &quot;warrior class&quot; troops. TV: The Timeless Children Summoning the Cybermen to Gallifrey, the Master kills the lone Cyberman in order to access the Cyberium. Creating the CyberMasters from the bodies of the dead Time Lords, the Master and his Cyber-Army are apparently destroyed by Ko Sharmus with a Death particle. TV: Nightmare in Silver Authorial intent places Nightmare in Silver &quot;a quarter of a million years into the future&quot;[1] The Cyber-Wars, which appear to be different to the one with Voga, were 1,000 years ago when the Tiberian spiral galaxy was destroyed. Both Cybus and Cyber Legion suits are seen as relics of the war. A new army of Cyberiad Cybermen appear at Hedgewick's World of Wonders but are destroyed, with the exception of a single Cybermite. The Eleventh Doctor's Gallifreyan physiology barely resists cyber-conversion. AUDIO: The Reaping The Cyberleader is one of the last Cybermen. AUDIO: The Gathering The cyber-technology from The Reaping is used to enhance human medical technology. End of the universe - COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen Banished from Gallifrey by the Twelfth Doctor, Rassilon joins forces with the Cybermen. Conquering Gallifrey, the Cybermen attack various points in history in a bid to convert all of time and space. Ultimately, the Cybermen betray Rassilon, who works with the Doctor to regenerate the universe, reverting all the damage they had caused. Pete's World[edit | edit source] 2007 (Pete's World) - TV: Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel The Tenth Doctor discovers the Cybermen in a parallel Earth, created by Cybus Industries CEO John Lumic. Converted into Cyber-Controller, Lumic intends to upgrade all of humanity but is killed when London's Cybus factory is destroyed. However, other factories existed across the world. Mickey Smith decides to &quot;liberate Paris&quot;. A Cybus factory worker salvages some parts. (PROSE: Going Off the Rails) GAME: Save Paris The Preachers neutralise the Cybus factory in Paris. PROSE: Going Off the Rails The factory worker's son and a friend use the parts to assemble a Cyberman. Both unfamiliar with the Cyberman, they manage to destroy it before it can upgrade them. GAME: Cyber Assault A war is raged across Earth between the Preachers and the Cybermen. Ultimately, the Preachers win and the Cybermen are sealed in their factories. 2010 (Pete's World)/2007 (N-Space) - TV: Army of Ghosts/Doomsday Over a period of three years, approximately 5 million Cybermen travel through the void to N-Space, resulting in the Battle of Canary Wharf. These Cybermen are eventually sucked back into the Void by the Tenth Doctor. TV: The Next Doctor A group of Cybermen escape from the Void and end up in London in the 1850s, where they are destroyed by the Tenth Doctor. 2007 (N-Space) - TV: Cyberwoman Lisa Hallett, who was partially converted into a Cyberman at Canary Wharf, is found and killed at Torchwood Three. 2008 (N-Space) - PROSE: Made of Steel Less than half a dozen Cybermen from Canary Wharf attempt to build up the Cyber race but are defeated by the Tenth Doctor.

Play Sound Dark Horse Comics Founded 1986[1] Founder(s) Mike Richardson[1] Headquarters Milwaukie, Oregon[2] Official website Dark Horse Comics (Source) &quot;Our goal was to create sequels and prequels to the films we loved, paying careful attention to quality and detail, essentially treating those films as though they were our own. Star Wars has been the crown jewel of this approach.&quot; ―Mike Richardson, on the end of Dark Horse's initial Star Wars publishing run[src] Dark Horse Comics is a publisher of comic books that over the years has produced many licensed works, a large number of which take place in the Star Wars universe. Dark Horse began publishing comics in 1986 and first published for Star Wars with Star Wars: Dark Empire in 1991.[3] Dark Horse has also republished the Marvel Star Wars comics and has produced several compilations of works, including the aforementioned Marvel works, in a collection of trade paperbacks known as Star Wars Omnibus. The Omnibus imprint is also used for other fictional universes such as Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Dark Horse has a division called Dark Horse Digital, which allows customers to view comics online. On January 3, 2014, Disney announced that the Star Wars comics license would move from Dark Horse back to Marvel in 2015.[4] After a six-year-long hiatus, it was announced on November 18, 2021, that Dark Horse would return to publishing Star Wars comics in 2022. Multiple series are planned for the new program, with initial titles being part of the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative[5] published in the spring of 2022. This re-launch of the Dark Horse Star Wars brand will also include one-shots, graphic novels, anthologies, and more.[6] Contents 1 Bibliography 1.1 Legends comics 1.2 Republished collections 1.3 Art books 2 Forthcoming 3 Sources 4 Notes and references 5 External links Bibliography Legends comics Star Wars: Dark Empire (1991–1992) Classic Star Wars (1992–2003) Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (1993–1998) Star Wars: Droids (1994–1997) Star Wars: Dark Empire II (1994–1995) Jabba the Hutt (1995–1996) Star Wars: Empire's End (1995) Star Wars: River of Chaos (1995) The Thrawn Trilogy (1995–1998) Star Wars: Boba Fett (1995–2006) Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1995–1996) Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron (1995–1998) Shadows of the Empire (1996) Star Wars: Tales from Mos Eisley (1996) Battle of the Bounty Hunters (1996) Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition (1997) Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire (1997) Shadow Stalker (1997) Star Wars: Crimson Empire (1997–1998) Shadows of the Empire: Evolution (1998) Dark Forces: Rebel Agent (1998) Dark Forces: Jedi Knight (1998) The Jabba Tape (1998) Jedi Academy: Leviathan (1998–1999) Star Wars: Mara Jade – By the Emperor's Hand (1998–1999) Crimson Empire II: Council of Blood (1998–1999) Star Wars: Republic (1998–2006) Vader's Quest (1999) Star Wars: The Bounty Hunters (1999) Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace (1999) Episode I: The Phantom Menace ½ (1999) Episode I: Obi-Wan Kenobi (1999) Episode I: Queen Amidala (1999) Episode I: Qui-Gon Jinn (1999) Episode I: Anakin Skywalker (1999) Star Wars Tales (1999–2005) Star Wars: Union (1999–2000) Chewbacca (2000) Star Wars: Darth Maul (2000) Jedi Council: Acts of War (2000) Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: Last Stand on Ord Mantell (2000) Jedi vs. Sith (2001) Jedi Quest (2001) Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika (2000–2001) Star Wars: Infinities (2001–2004) Starfighter: Crossbones (2002) Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones (2002) Star Wars: Jango Fett (2002) Star Wars: Zam Wesell (2002) Jango Fett: Open Seasons (2002) Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: The Aurorient Express (2002) Star Wars: Empire (2002–2006) Star Wars: Jedi (2003–2004) A Valentine Story (2003) Star Wars: Obsession (2004–2005) Clone Wars Adventures (2004–2007) X-Wing: Rogue Leader (2005) General Grievous (2005) Star Wars: Visionaries (2005) Star Wars—Free Comic Book Day 2005 Special (2005) Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith (2005) Star Wars: Purge (2005) Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2006–2010) Star Wars: Rebellion (2006–2008) Star Wars: Legacy (2006–2010) Star Wars: Dark Times (2006–2013) Star Wars: Vector (2008) Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2010) Star Wars: The Clone Wars graphic novellas (2008–2013) Star Wars Adventures (2009–2011) Star Wars: The Old Republic (2009–2011) Star Wars: Invasion (2009–2011) Star Wars: Blood Ties (2010–2012) Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II (2010) Star Wars: Knight Errant (2010–2012) Star Wars: Legacy—War (2010–2011) Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Lost Command (2011) Star Wars: Jedi—The Dark Side (2011) Star Wars: Crimson Empire III—Empire Lost (2011–2012) Star Wars: Agent of the Empire (2011–2013) Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Ghost Prison (2012) Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: War (2012) Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi (2012–2014) Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith—Spiral (2012) Star Wars (2013–2014) Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2 (2013–2014) Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Ninth Assassin (2013) Star Wars: Darth Maul—Death Sentence (2012) Star Wars: Ewoks—Shadows of Endor (2013) Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Cry of Shadows (2013–2014) The Star Wars (2013–2014) Star Wars: Rebel Heist (2014) Star Wars: Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir (2014) Star Wars: Dark Times Gallery Edition (2014) Republished collections Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures (1994–1995) Classic Star Wars Volume 1: In Deadly Pursuit (1994) Classic Star Wars Volume 2: The Rebel Storm (1995) Classic Star Wars Volume 3: Escape to Hoth (1996) Classic Star Wars: A Long Time Ago...

It does nearly all I/O asynchronously using io_uring if available (Linux 5.1+), which reduces the impact of seek latency on systems without SSDs. Like mlocate and slocate, the returned file set is user-dependent, ie. a user will only see a file if find(1) would list it (all directories from the root have +rx permissions).

                   NS1:content=" 对比了 Python、Go 和 Rust 之后，我们得出了这个结论 本文主要是从 Python 开发者的角度基于开发工效学对这三种语言进行的一个比较，你可以跳过讨论部分，直接查看代码示例、性能比较、主要结论或 Python、Go 和 Rust 的 diffimg 实现。 本文主要是从 Python 开发者的角度基于开发工效学对这三种语言进行的一个比较，你可以跳过讨论部分，直接查看代码示例、性能比较（如果你想要一些硬数据）、主要结论或 Python 、 Go 和 Rust 的 diffimg 实现。 几年前，我负责重写一个图像处理服务。为了弄清楚对于给定的图像和一个或多个转换（调整大小、圆形裁剪、修改格式等），我的新服务创建的输出是否和旧服务一致，我必须自己检查图像。显然，我需要自动化，但我找不到一个现有的 Python 库可以告诉我，这两张图片在像素级上有什么不同，因此有了diffimg ，它可以给你一个差异比 / 百分比，或生成差异图像（检出 readme，里面有一个例子）。 我最初是用 Python 实现的（我最熟悉的语言），主要部分使用了 Pillow 。它可以用作库或命令行工具。程序的基本部分非常小，只有几十行，这要感谢Pillow。构建这个工具并不费力（ xkcd 是对的，几乎所有东西都有一个 Python 模块），但它至少对于除我自己之外的几十人是有用的。 几个月前，我加入了一家公司，他们有几个服务是用 Go 编写的，我需要快速上手这门语言。编写diffimg-go 看起来很有趣，甚至可能是一种有用的方法。这里有一些来自经验的兴趣点，以及一些在工作中使用它的兴趣点。 对比 Python 和 Go （代码： diffimg （Python）和 diffimg-go ） 标准库：Go 有一个相当不错的 image 标准库模块，以及命令行 flag 解析库。我不需要寻找任何外部依赖；diffimg-go 实现没有依赖，而 Python 实现使用了相当重量级的第三方模块（讽刺的是）Pillow。Go 的标准库更有条理，而且经过深思熟虑，而 Python 的会逐步发展，它们是多年来由许多作者创建的，有许多不同的约定。Go 标准库的一致性使开发者更易于预测任何给定的模块将如何发挥作用，而且源代码有非常好的文档记录。 使用标准 image 库的一个缺点是它不自动检测图像是否有一个 alpha 通道；所有图像类型的像素值都有四个通道（RGBA）。因此，diffimg-go 实现要求用户指明是否要使用 alpha 通道。这个小小的不便不值得找第三方库来修复。 一个很大的好处是，标准库中有足够的内容，你不需要像 Django 这样的 Web 框架。用 Go 有可能在没有任何依赖关系的情况下建立一个真正可用的 Web 服务。Python 号称“自带电池（batteries-included）”，但在我看来，Go 做得更好。 静态类型系统：我过去使用静态类型语言，但我过去几年一直在使用 Python 编程。体验起初有点烦人，感觉它好像只是减慢了我的速度，它迫使我过度明确，即使我偶尔错了，Python 也会让我做我想做的。有点像你给人发指令而对方总是打断你让你阐明你是什么意思，而有的人则总是点头，看上去已经理解你，但是你并不确定他们是否已经全部了解。它将大大减少与类型相关的 Bug，但是我发现，我仍然需要花几乎相同的时间编写测试。 Go 的一个常见缺点是它没有用户可实现的泛型类型。虽然这不是一个构建大型可扩展应用程序的必备特性，但它肯定会减缓开发速度。虽然已经有替代模式建议，但是它们中没有一个和真正的泛型类型一样有效。 静态类型系统的一个优点是，可以更简单快速地阅读不熟悉的代码库。用好类型可以带来许多动态类型系统中会丢失的额外信息。 接口和结构：Go 使用接口和结构，而 Python 使用类。在我看来，这可能是最有趣的区别，因为它迫使我区分定义行为的类型和保存信息的类型这两个概念。Python 和其他传统的面向对象的语言都鼓励你将它们混在一起，但这两种范式各有利弊： Go 强烈建议组合而不是继承。虽然它通过嵌入继承，不用类，但其数据和方法不是那么容易传递。通常，我认为组合是更好的默认模式，但我不是一个绝对主义者，在某些情况下继承更合适，所以我不喜欢语言帮我作出这个决定。 接口实现的分离意味着，如果有许多类型彼此相似，你就需要多次编写类似的代码。由于缺少泛型类型，在 Go 中，有些情况下我无法重用代码，不过在 Python 中可以。 然而，由于 Go 是静态类型的，当你编写的代码会导致运行时错误时，编译器 / 源码分析器（linter）会告诉你。Python 源码分析器也可以有一点这样的功能。但在 Python 中，当你试图访问一个可能不存在的方法或属性时，由于语言的动态性，Python 源码分析器无法确切地知道什么方法 / 属性存在，直到运行时。静态定义的接口和结构是唯一在编译时和开发过程中知道什么可用的方法，这使得编译时报错的 Go 比运行时报错的 Python 更可靠。 没有可选参数：Go 只有可变函数，类似于 Python 的关键字参数，但不那么有用，因为参数需要是相同的类型。我发现关键字参数是我真正怀念的特性，这主要是你可以把任何类型的一个 kwarg 扔给任何需要它的函数，而无需重写它的每一个调用，这让重构简单了许多。我在工作中经常使用这个特性，它为我节省了很多时间。由于没有该特性，这使得我在处理是否应该基于命令行标志创建差异图像时显得有些笨拙。 冗长：Go 有点冗长（尽管不是像 Java 那么冗长）。这部分是因为其类型系统没有泛型，但主要是因为语言本身很小，没有提供很多特性（你只有一种循环结构可以使用！）。我怀念Python 的列表推导式（list comprehensions）和其他函数式编程特性。如果你熟悉Python，你一两天就可以学完 Tour of Go ，然后你就了解了整个语言。 错误处理：Python 有异常，而 Go 在可能出错的地方通过从函数返回元组 value， error 来传播错误。Python 允许你在调用栈中的任何位置捕获错误，而不需要你一次又一次地手动将错误传递回去。这又使得代码简洁，而不像 Go 那样被其臭名昭著的 if err != nil 模式搞得杂乱无章，不过你需要弄清楚函数及其内部的所有调用可能抛出的异常（使用 except Exception: 通常是一种糟糕的变通方案）。良好的文档注释和测试可以提供帮助，你在使用其中任何一种语言编程时都应该添加。Go 的系统绝对更安全。如果你忽视了 err 值，你还是可以搬起石头砸自己的脚，但该系统使糟糕的主意变得更明显。 第三方模块：在 Go 模块出现之前，Go 的包管理器会把所有下载的包扔到 GOPATH/src目录下，而不是项目的目录（像大多数其他语言）。GOPATH/src目录下，而不是项目的目录（像大多数其他语言）。GOPATH 下这些模块的路径也会从托管包的 URL 构建，所以你的 import 语句将是类似 import &quot;github.com/someuser/somepackage &quot; 这个样子。在几乎所有 Go 代码库的源代码中嵌入 github.com 似乎是一个奇怪的选择。在任何情况下，Go 允许以传统的方式做事，但 Go 模块仍然是个很新的特性，所以在一段时间内，在缺少管理的 Go 代码库中，这种奇怪的行为仍将很常见。 异步性：Goroutines 是启动异步任务的一种非常方便的方法。在 async/await 之前，Python 的异步解决方案有点令人沮丧。遗憾的是，我没有用 Python 或 Go 编写很多真实的异步代码，而 diffimg 的简单性似乎并不适合说明异步性的额外开销，所以我没有太多要说的，虽然我确实喜欢使用 Go 的channels 来处理多个异步任务。我的理解是，对于性能，Go 仍然占了上风了，因为 goroutine 可以充分利用多处理器并发，而 Python 的基本 async/await 仍局限于一个处理器，所以主要用于 I / O 密集型任务。 调试：Python 胜出。pdb（以及像 ipdb 这样更复杂的选项）非常灵活，一旦你进入 REPL，你可以编写任何你想要的代码。 Delve 是一个很好的调试器，但和直接放入解释器不一样，语言的全部功能都唾手可得。 Go 总结 我对 Go 最初的印象是，由于它的抽象能力（有意为之）有限，所以它不像 Python 那样有趣。Python 有更多的特性，因此有更多的方法来做一些事情，找到最快、最易读或“最聪明”的解决方案可能会很有趣。Go 会积极地阻止你变得“聪明”。我认为，Go 的优势在于它并不聪明。 它的极简主义和缺乏自由限制了单个开发人员实现一个想法。然而，当项目扩展到几十个或几百个开发人员时，这个弱点变成了它的力量——因为每个人都使用同样的语言特性小工具集，更容易统一，因此可以被他人理解。使用 Go 仍有可能编写糟糕的代码，但与那些更“强大”的语言相比，它让你更难创造怪物。 使用一段时间后，我理解了为什么像谷歌这样的公司想要一门这样的语言。新工程师不断地加入到大量代码库的开发，在更复杂 / 更强大的语言中，在最后期限的压力下，引入复杂性的速度比它被消除的速度更快。防止这种情况发生的最好方法是使用一种更不容易产生复杂性的语言。 所以说，我很高兴工作在一个大型应用程序上下文中的 Go 代码库上，有一个多样化和不断增长的团队。事实上，我认为我更喜欢它。我只是不想把它用于我自己的个人项目。 进入 Rust 几周前，我决定尝试学习 Rust。我之前曾试图这样做，但发现类型系统和借用检查（borrow checker）让人困惑，没有足够的背景信息，我不知道为什么要把所有这些限制强加给我，对于我想做的任务来说大而笨重。然而，自那时以来，我对程序执行时内存中发生了什么有了更多的了解。我从这本书开始，而不是试图一头扎进去。这有很大的帮助，这份介绍比我见过的任何编程语言的介绍都要好。 在我读过这本书的前十几章之后，我觉得自己有足够的信心尝试 diffimg 的另一个实现（这时，我觉得我的 Rust 经验与我写 diffimg-go 时的 Go 经验一样多）。这比我用 Go 实现的时间要长，而后者比用 Python 需要的时间更长。我认为，即使考虑到我对 Python 更加熟悉，这也是对的——两种语言都有更多的东西要写。 在编写 diffimg-rs 时，我注意到一些事情。 类型系统：现在，我已经习惯 Go 中更基本的静态类型系统了，但 Rust 更强大（也更复杂）。有了 Go 中接口和结构的基础（它们都简单得多），泛型类型、枚举类型、traits、引用类型、生命周期就是全部我要额外学习的概念了。此外，Rust 使用其类型系统实现其它语言不使用类型系统实现的特性（如 Result ，我很快会介绍）。幸运的是，编译器 / 源码解析器非常有帮助，它可以告诉你你做错了什么，甚至经常告诉你如何解决这个问题。尽管如此，这比我学习 Go 的类型系统所用的时间要多得多，我还没有适应它的所有特性。 有一个地方，因为类型系统，我正在使用的图像库的实现会导致令人不快的代码重复量。我最终只要匹配两个最重要的枚举类型，但匹配其他类型会导致另外半打左右几乎相同的代码行。在这个规模上，这不是一个问题，但它使我生气。也许这里使用宏是个不错的主意，我仍然需要试验。 复制代码 letmutdiff =matchimage1.color() { image::ColorType::RGB(_) =&gt; image::DynamicImage::new_rgb8(w， h)， image::ColorType::RGBA(_) =&gt; image::DynamicImage::new_rgba8(w， h)， // 继续匹配所有 7 种类型？ _ =&gt;returnErr( format!(&quot;color mode {:?} not yet supported&quot;， image1.color()) )， }； 手动内存管理：Python 和 Go 会帮你捡垃圾。C 允许你乱丢垃圾，但当它踩到你丢的香蕉皮时，它会大发脾气。Rust 会拍你一下，并要求你自己清理干净。这会刺痛我，甚至超过了从动态类型语言迁移到静态类型语言，因为我被宠坏了，通常都是由语言跟在我后面捡。此外，编译器会设法尽可能地帮助你，但你仍然需要大量的学习才能理解到底发生了什么。 直接访问内存（以及 Rust 的函数式编程特性）的一个好处是，它简化了差异比的计算，因为我可以简单地映射原始字节数组，而不必按坐标索引每个像素。 函数式特性：Rust 强烈鼓励函数式的方法：它有 FP 友好的类型系统（类似 Haskell）、不可变类型、闭包，迭代器，模式匹配等，但也允许命令式代码。它类似于编写 OCaml（有趣的是，最初的 Rust 编译器是用 OCaml 编写的）。因此，对于这门与 C 竞争的语言，代码比你想象得更简洁。 错误处理：不同于 Python 使用的异常模型，也不同于 Go 异常处理时返回的元组，Rust 利用枚举类型：Result 返回 Ok(value) 或 Err(error)。这和 Go 的方式更接近，但更明确一些，而且利用了类型系统。还有一个语法糖用于检查语句中的 Err 并提前返回：? 操作符（在我看来，Go 可以用类似这样的东西）。 异步性：Rust 的 async/await 还没有完全准备好，但最终语法最近已经达成一致。Rust 标准库中也有一些基本的线程特性，看上去比 Python 的更容易使用，但我没有花太多的时间了解它。Go 似乎仍然有最好的特性。 工具：rustup 和 cargo 分别是非常优秀的语言版本管理器和包 / 模块管理器实现。一切“正常”。我特别喜欢自动生成的文档。对于这些工具，Python 提供的选项有点太简单，需要小心对待，正如我之前提到的，Go 有一种奇怪的管理模块方式，但除此之外，它的工具比 Python 的更好。 编辑器插件：我的. vimrc 文件大到令人尴尬，至少有三十多个插件。我有一些用于代码检查、自动补全以及格式化 Python 和 Go 的插件，但相比于其他两种语言，Rust 插件更容易设置，更有用、更一致。 rust.vim 和 vim-lsp 插件（以及 Rust 语言服务器）是我获得一个非常强大的配置所需要的全部。我还没有测试其他编辑器，但是，借助 Rust 提供的编辑器无关的优秀工具，我认为它们一样有帮助。这个设置提供了我使用过的最好的“转到定义”。它可以很好地适用于本地、标准库和开箱即用的第三方代码。 调试：我还没有尝试过 Rust 的调试器（因为其类型系统和 println! 已经让我走得很远)，但是你可以使用 rust-gdb 和 rust-lldb，以及 rustup 初始安装时带有的 gdb 和 lldb 调试器的封装器。如果你之前在编写 C 语言代码时使用过那些调试器，那么其使用体验将是意料之中的。正如前面提到的，编译器的错误消息非常有帮助。 Rust 总结 你至少要读过这本书的前几章，否则我绝对不建议你尝试编写 Rust 代码，即使你已经熟悉 C 和内存管理。对于 Go 和 Python，只要你有一些另一种现代命令式编程语言的经验，它们就不是很难入手，必要时可以参考文档。Rust 是一门很大的语言。Python 也有很多特性，但是它们大部分是可选的。只要理解一些基本的数据结构和一些内置函数，你就可以完成很多工作。对于 Rust，你需要真正理解类型系统的固有复杂性和借用检查，否则你会搞得十分复杂。 就我写 Rust 时的感觉而言，它非常有趣，就像 Python 一样。它广泛的特性使它很有表现力。虽然编译器会经常让你停下，但它也非常有用，而且它对于如何解决你的借用问题 / 输入问题的建议通常是有效的。正如我所提到的，这些工具是我遇到的所有语言中最好的，并且不像我使用的其他一些语言那样给我带来很多麻烦。我非常喜欢使用这种语言，并将在 Python 的性能还不够好的地方继续寻找使用 Rust 的机会。 代码示例 我提取了每个 diffimg 中计算差异比的代码块。为了概括介绍 Python 的做法，这需要 Pillow 生成的差异图像，对所有通道的所有像素值求和，并返回最大可能值（相同大小的纯白图像）除以总和的比值。 Python 复制代码 diff_img= ImageChops.difference(im1， im2) stat= ImageStat.Stat(diff_img) sum_channel_values= sum(stat.mean) max_all_channels= len(stat.mean) *255 diff_ratio= sum_channel_values / max_all_channels 对于 Go 和 Rust，方法有点不同：我们不用创建一个差异图像，我们只要遍历两幅输入图像，并对每个像素的差异求和。在 Go 中，我们用坐标索引每幅图像…… Go 复制代码 funcGetRatio(im1， im2 image.Image， ignoreAlphabool)float64{ varsumuint64 width， height := getWidthAndHeight(im1) fory :=0； y &lt; height； y++ { forx :=0； x &lt; width； x++ { sum +=uint64(sumPixelDiff(im1， im2， x， y， ignoreAlpha)) } } varnumChannels =4 ifignoreAlpha { numChannels =3 } totalPixVals := (height * width) * (maxChannelVal * numChannels) returnfloat64(sum) /float64(totalPixVals) } ……但在 Rust 中，我们将图像视为它们真的是在内存中，是一系列可以压缩到一起并消费的字节。 Rust 复制代码 pubfncalculate_diff( image1: DynamicImage， image2: DynamicImage ) -&gt;f64{ letmax_val =u64::pow(2，8) -1； letmutdiffsum:u64=0； for(&amp;p1， &amp;p2)inimage1 .raw_pixels() .iter() .zip(image2.raw_pixels().iter()) { diffsum +=u64::from(abs_diff(p1， p2))； } lettotal_possible = max_val * image1.raw_pixels().len()asu64； letratio = diffsumasf64/ total_possibleasf64； ratio } 对于这些例子，有一些事情需要注意： Python 的代码最少。显然，这在很大程度上取决于使用的图像库，但这说明了使用 Python 的一般体验。在许多情况下，那些库为你做了很多工作，因为生态系统非常发达，任何东西都有成熟的解决方案。 在 Go 和 Rust 示例中有类型转换。每个代码块中都使用了三个数值类型：用于像素通道值的 uint8/u8（Go 和 Rust 有类型推断，所以你看不到任何明确提及的类型）、用于总和的 uint64/u64 和用于最终比值的 float64/f64。对于 Go 和 Rust，需要花时间统一类型，而 Python 将隐式地完成这一切。 Go 实现的风格是命令式的，但也是明确和可以理解的（使其稍显欠缺的是我前面提到的 ignoreAlpha），甚至是对那些不习惯该语言的人也是如此。Python 示例相当清晰，一旦你理解了 ImageStat 在做什么。对于那些不熟悉这种语言的人来说，Rust 肯定更加难懂： .raw_pixels() 获取图像，生成 8 位无符号整数向量； .iter() 为该向量创建一个迭代器。默认情况下，向量是不可遍历的； .zip() 你可能了解，它接受两个迭代器，然后生成一个迭代器，每个元素是一个元组：（来自第一个向量的元素，来自第二个向量的元素）； 在 diffsum 声明中，我们需要一个 mut，因为变量默认是不可变的； 如果你熟悉 C，你就会明白为什么 for (&amp;p1， &amp;p2) 中有 &amp;：迭代器生成像素值的引用，但 abs_diff() 自己取得它们的值。Go 支持指针（和引用不太一样），但它们不同于 Rust 中常用的引用。 函数中的最后一个语句用于在没有行结束符 ; 的情况作为返回值。其他一些函数式语言也是这样做的。 这段是为了让你了解需要掌握多少特定于语言的知识才能有效地使用 Rust。 性能 现在来做一个科学的比较。我首先生成三张不同尺寸的随机图像：1x1、2000x2000、10000x10000。然后我测量每个（语言、图像大小）组合的性能，每个 diffimg 计算 10 次，然后取平均值，使用 time 命令的 real 值给出的值。diffimg-rs 使用–release 构建，diffimg-go 使用 go build，而 Python diffimg 通过 python3 - m diffimg 调用。以下是在 2015 年的 Macbook Pro 上获得的结果： 图像大小1x12000x200010000x10000 Rust0.001s0.490s5.871s Go0.002s (2x)0.756s (1.54x)14.060s (2.39x) Python0.095s (95x)1.419s (2.90x)28.751s (4.89x) 我损失了很多精度，因为 time 只精确到 10ms（因为计算平均值的缘故，这里多显示了一个数字）。该任务只需要一个非常特定类型的计算，所以不同的或更复杂的任务得出的数值可能差别很大。话虽如此，我们还是可以从这些数据中了解到一些东西。 对于 1x1 的图像，几乎所有的时间都花费在设置中，没有比例计算。Rust 获胜，尽管它使用了两个第三方库（ clap 和 image ），Go 只使用了标准库。我并不惊讶 Python 的启动那么缓慢，因为导入大库 Pillow 是它的一个步骤，time python -c ’ '其实只用了 0.030 秒。 对于 2000x2000 的图像，Go 和 Python 与 Rust 的差距就缩小了，这大概是因为与计算相比，用于设置的时间更少。然而，对于 10000 年 x10000 的图像，Rust 相比较之下性能更好，我想这是由于其编译器优化所生成的机器代码最小（循环 1 亿次），设置时间相对就比较少了。从不需要暂停进行垃圾收集也是一个因素。 Python 实现肯定还有很大的改进余地，因为像 Pillow 那么高效，我们仍然是在内存中创建一张差异图像（遍历输入图像），然后累加每个像素的通道值。更直接的方法，比如 Go 和 Rust 实现，可能会稍微快一些。然而，纯 Python 实现会非常慢，因为 Pillow 主要是用 C 完成其工作。因为另外两个是纯粹用一种语言实现的，这不是一个真正公平的比较，虽然在某些方面是，因为得益于 C 扩展（Python 和 C 的关系一般都非常紧密 ），Python 有一大堆高性能库可以使用。 我还应该提下二进制文件的大小：Rust 的 2.1MB，使用–release 构建，Go 的大小差不多，为 2.5 MB。Python 不创建二进制文件，但是.pyc 文件有一定的可比性，和 diffimg 的.pyc 文件总共约 3 KB。它的源代码也只有 3KB，但是包括 Pillow 依赖的话，它将达 24MB。再说一次，这不是一个公平的比较，因为我使用了一个第三方图像库，但应该提一下。 结论 显然，这三种截然不同的语言实现满足不同的细分市场需求。我经常听到 Go 和 Rust 被一起提及，但我认为，Go 和 Python 是两种类似 / 存在竞争关系的语言。它们都很适合编写服务器端应用程序逻辑（我在工作中大部分时间都在做这项工作）。仅比较原生代码的性能，Go 完胜 Python，但许多有速度要求的 Python 库是对速度更快的 C 实现的封装——实际情况比这种天真的比较更复杂。编写一个用于 Python 的 C 扩展不能完全算是 Python 了（你需要了解 C），但这个选项是对你开放的。 对于你的后端服务器需求，Python 已被证明它对于大多数应用程序都“足够快”，但是如果你需要更好的性能，Go 可以，Rust 更是如此，但是你要付出更多的开发时间。Go 在这方面并没有超出 Python 很多，虽然开发肯定是慢一些，这主要是由于其较小的特性集。Rust 的特性非常齐全，但管理内存总是比由语言自己管理会花费更多的时间，这好过处理 Go 的极简性。 还应该提一下，世界上有很多很多 Python 开发人员，有些有几十年的经验。如果你选择 Python，那么找到更多有语言经验的人加入到你的后端团队中可能并不难。然而，Go 开发人员并不是特别少，而且很容易发展，因为这门语言很容易学习。由于 Rust 这种语言需要更长的时间内化，所以开发人员更少，也更难发展。 至于系统类型：静态类型系统更容易编写更多正确的代码，但它不是万能的。无论使用何种语言，你仍然需要编写综合测试。它需要更多的训练，但是我发现，我使用 Python 编写的代码并不一定比 Go 更容易出错，只要我能够编写一个好的测试套件。尽管如此，相比于 Go，我更喜欢 Rust 的类型系统：它支持泛型、模式匹配、错误处理，它通常为你做得更多。 最后，这种比较有点愚蠢，因为尽管这些语言的用例重叠，但它们占领着不同的细分市场。Python 开发速度快、性能低，而 Rust 恰恰相反，Go 则介于两者之间。我喜欢 Python 和 Rust 超过 Go（这可能令人奇怪），不过我会继续在工作中愉快地使用 Go（以及 Python），因为它真的是一种构建稳定、可维护的应用程序的伟大语言，它有许多来自不同背景的贡献者。它的僵硬和极简主义使它使用起来不那么令人愉快（对我来说），但这也正是它的力量所在。如果我要为一个新的 Web 应用程序选择后端语言的话，那将是 Go。 我对这三种语言所涵盖的编程任务范围相当满意——实际上，没有哪个项目不能把它们中的一种视为很好的选择。 英文原文：One Program Written in Python， Go， and Rust " />

Now it’s time to open it up to a wider audience. raspberry pi os 64-bit The ARMv8-A architecture, which encompasses the 64-bit AArch64 architecture and associated A64 instruction set, was first introduced into the Raspberry Pi line with Raspberry Pi 3 in 2016. From that point on, it has been possible to run a full 64-bit operating system on our flagship products, and many third-party operating systems are available. However, we have continued to build our Raspberry Pi OS releases on the 32-bit Raspbian platform, aiming to maximise compatibility between devices and to avoid customer confusion. Product Processor ARM core Debian/Raspbian ARM port (maximum) Architecture width Raspberry Pi 1 BCM2835 ARM1176 arm6hf 32 bit Raspberry Pi 2 BCM2836 Cortex-A7 armhf 32 bit Raspberry Pi Zero BCM2835 ARM1176 arm6hf 32 bit Raspberry Pi Zero 2 BCM2710 Cortex-A53 arm64 64 bit Raspberry Pi 3 BCM2710 Cortex-A53 arm64 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4 BCM2711 Cortex-A72 arm64 64 bit As you can see from the table above, it is easy to be confused about which products will support which Debian/Raspbian ports. Using arm6hf (Raspbian’s derivative of armhf with ARMv7-only instructions removed but floating-point instructions retained) provides us with an operating system which will run on every device we have ever manufactured, all the way back to 2011. But we’ve come to realise that there are reasons to choose a 64-bit operating system over a 32-bit one. Compatibility is a key concern: many closed-source applications are only available for arm64, and open-source ones aren’t fully optimised for the armhf port. Beyond that there are some performance benefits intrinsic to the A64 instruction set: today, these are most visible in benchmarks, but the assumption is that these will feed through into real-world application performance in the future. A more theoretical concern is that 32-bit pointers only allow you to address 4GB of memory. On Raspberry Pi 4, we use the ARM Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE) to access up to 8GB of memory, subject to the constraint that any process is limited to accessing 3GB (we reserve the top 1GB of the virtual address space for the kernel). Very few processes require more memory than this: happily Chromium, which is probably the most memory-intensive application in Raspberry Pi OS, spawns a process per tab. But some use cases will benefit from being able to allocate the entire memory of an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 from a single process. The 64-bit version of Chromium, installed by default, has no version of the WidevineCDM library and therefore, it is not possible to play streaming media such as Netflix or Disney+. To instead choose the 32-bit version just do the following within a terminal window: sudo apt install chromium-browser:armhf libwidevinecdm0 To return to the 64-bit version sudo apt install chromium-browser:arm64 libwidevinecdm0- So, head to the downloads page and grab your copy of 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS today. Let us know in the comments if your use case benefits (or suffers!) from the move to 64-bit.

My use case is __uint128_t which is not available on 32-bit systems so yes, I’ll benefit. Reply to Anton Avatar Tejas 2nd February 2022, 10:30 am Woah! That’s a big announcement. I’m so happy that Pi OS 64 bit is now official Reply to Tejas Avatar Salvador Liébana 2nd February 2022, 10:48 am It’s based on your own repo or just debian repo like before?? There isn’t enough info for such announcements… Reply to Salvador Liébana Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 2nd February 2022, 11:17 am The upstream of the 32bit OS is Raspbian (which is just a rebuild of Debian for ARM6 with hard float extensions). The upstream of the 64bit OS is Debian. But both of them have our own sprinkled magic to make it Raspberry Pi OS. Including hardware acceleration Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar James Richmond 2nd February 2022, 6:20 pm Excellent work! How does the video decoding work? Does it use the mmal decoder like the 32bit? Reply to James Richmond Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 3rd February 2022, 6:20 am No, we don’t use the MMAL interface anymore, we use V4L2 – stateless for Chromium and VLC. Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar David Earl 2nd February 2022, 10:55 am I’ve been using 64 but for a while, because Elasticsearch does not have a supported 32 bit version for ARM (though it can be forced to work if the components are unpacked and installed manually). Also, I had at least one issue with 32 bit ints in PHP storing time stamps. Reply to David Earl Avatar Archisman Panigrahi 2nd February 2022, 11:10 am Does the hardware acceleration work? The GitHub issue is still open. https://github.com/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-OS-64bit/issues/52 Reply to Archisman Panigrahi Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 2nd February 2022, 11:18 am Video acceleration works through Chromium and VLC, GPU acceleration works through Mesa, the same as it does on the 32bit hardware Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Phill michael 2nd February 2022, 4:53 pm Youtube will never work . It falls back to cpu decoding The drivers will never work with a web browser to ever get YouTube working Reply to Phill michael Avatar Joe 3rd February 2022, 4:22 am Hmm. I’m a dummy with all this but using twisteros YouTube streams fine with chromium and also the ap built in to twisteros. I will look I guess for twisteros in 64 bit I home soon. Reply to Joe Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 3rd February 2022, 6:26 am On Chromium YouTube works fine, just tried playing some trailers in 1080p from youtube fullscreen and it’s good… Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Ric Colasanti 2nd February 2022, 12:13 pm Just want to congratulate you on the work you have done on Pi operating systems. The effort on optimisation is very much appreciated. I use the PiOS desktop on a very underpowered laptop and it is the best OS I have found (and I have tried alot) an especial “tip of the hat” goes to your extension of LXDE Looking forward to install in 64 bit on my ZERO2 and PI4 Thanks again d Reply to Ric Colasanti Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 2nd February 2022, 12:36 pm I’d suggest only the lite version on the Pi Zero 2, 512MB is very limiting for the 64bit desktop OS Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Charles Steinkuehler 2nd February 2022, 12:20 pm I’ve also been using 64-bit for a while and see significant performance improvements. Use case is a SW codec for video streaming which heavily uses NEON intrinsics (the NewTek NDI SDK). Reply to Charles Steinkuehler Avatar Laurent 2nd February 2022, 1:24 pm Congratulations for this release ! I have been successfully testing the beta since the begining and it was already great. Software support for the Pi is a valuable strength upon other SBC manufacturers, and this release is really a huge milestone. Ironically, though, the Raspberry Pi OS released for celebrating the 10 years of the original Pi, can’t run on it ^^ Reply to Laurent Avatar Glas 2nd February 2022, 1:50 pm Hi, congrats on the release. If I had the x64 beta from December. What are the required steps to “update the os” to the stable one? I checked sources and sources.d and both are in bullseye. Also updated the firmware and that just jumped the kernel to .94. thanks in advance Reply to Glas Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 2nd February 2022, 2:32 pm sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade This should get you to the same position assuming you started with the recent Bullseye release (in 64-bit) Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar luckytriple6 2nd February 2022, 2:43 pm Can you install both 64 and 32 bit chromium and just switch between them? I’m sure you probably can, that it’d require extra configuration after the install to work, and I have better things to do with my time than fight a computer to give it basic functionality…. At this point I’m still not seeing a reason to once again try switching to 64bit. It was nothing less than a waste of time last I tried a few months ago, all I got out of it was anger… Constant crashes, dependency hell, and way too many of those crashes required re-imaging the disk bc they crashed so badly. I’m seriously glad I didn’t waste the money to buy an 8gb pi4, which was released just weeks after I finally bought a 4gb I purposely waited as long as I did to get a pi4 bc I’ve been using them since the original b+ was released. I know it takes a while to get all the bugs worked out with each new release. I’ve done enough beta testing in my life and was under the impression that 64bit was working when I bought it, not that it was still a beta back then. So it was a huge let down after spending all that money only to find out the apps I use weren’t gonna work with 64bit, which was the only reason I bought it Honestly I’m kinda sick of raspberry pi’s, they can be great little devices for many projects. But for many projects people use them for, like the media server/NAS/etc I bought it for. They are so not worth it! By the time you buy all the accessories, drives, hats, cords, etc, you may as well have gotten a cheap used desktop. No rats nest of wires, you can actually stream HD and even to more than one device at a time in a wider range of formats. Faster transfer rates on smb/nfs, a desktop could even be used as a desktop, which a pi is a horrible substitute for. And that’s not even to mention that you just can’t buy them now, unless you’re able to pay greedy scalpers over inflated prices. Covid inflation was bad enough to deal with, I’m not paying $100 for a $15 SOC… Reply to luckytriple6 Avatar Mark 3rd February 2022, 1:37 am Loving your optimistic takes on so many diverse points in your detailed post. It sounds like the Pi isn’t a great fit for you though. Reply to Mark Avatar Mike 2nd February 2022, 3:51 pm Is there a way to upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit without wiping out and starting again? Reply to Mike Avatar Axel 2nd February 2022, 9:58 pm Yes, it’s called “cross grading”. But it can be very tricky to avoid all pitfalls. See https://wiki.debian.org/CrossGrading for the details. Reply to Axel Avatar Phil 3rd February 2022, 1:01 pm So, crossgrading is possible, how about upgrading from lite to full. I’ve been playing with 64bit but have failed to get vnc working. A full desktop version might be better. Reply to Phil Avatar Gary Terry 3rd February 2022, 3:14 pm Crossgrading doesn’t really work… It seemed like it was working, but I can’t find a way to upgrade to the dpkg:arm64 Reply to Gary Terry Avatar Ferreol 2nd February 2022, 4:02 pm LEEETS GO is it possible to update without data wipe ? Reply to Ferreol Avatar MW 2nd February 2022, 4:19 pm Yes it is *feasible* if one has the knowledge to deal with all the issues which this would cause, but in practical and sanity terms best to start afresh with a clean install. Reply to MW Avatar Carl 2nd February 2022, 4:57 pm Is there anything in Raspberry Pi OS (or its repositories) that functions like Linux Mint’s “Backup Tool”? I’m just trying to figure out if there’s any program or application that would speed up the process of rebuilding my system (with all the programs I added, printer, scanner, config.txt tweaks, and so forth) to what it was before under the 32-bit system. I try to keep a record/journal of all that I’ve done, but it would be nice not to have to re-do it all manually. Esp. since I have three pi that might benefit from this (400, 3B+, and 3B). Reply to Carl Avatar Jozef Remen 2nd February 2022, 8:50 pm dd command in every unix flavor OS (linux, macOs, all BSDs etc.) Reply to Jozef Remen Avatar Neil Stoker 3rd February 2022, 1:55 am Hey Carl, Not sure if you’d think this was overkill, but longer term you might be interested in exploring tools like Ansible, since you can make your setup repeatable via scripts. Of course, that doesn’t help you so much with recreating your existing setup, but maybe you can get some of the way using one or both of these: 1. Use your bash history – I’d be tempted to copy it to a fresh file and then cut it down to the steps that were necessary and worked. That can then be used to make a start with Ansible or if you want to defer that, just paste the commands that look relevent. In some cases, eg with config changes to files, you won’t see what was changed from a command to open your editor, but at least you’ll know the files you may have updated so you can compare those. 2. If you’re mainly focused on the packages, then you can use the sort of techniques shown here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41277/146316 but you’ll still potentially need to make config changes (so might combine with 1 above) Point 2 should be somewhat reliable even if you did configuration via gui tools, but point 1 is not going to pick up any gui based editing of config. Reply to Neil Stoker Avatar Roger Whiteley 3rd February 2022, 10:07 am I’d agree with Neil’s post about Ansible, all the simple stuff, automated, all I do is boot once, logon, change the name, change the password, reboot. Then ssh-copy-id from my Ansible control machine [another Pi, or any other flavour of Linux] and then run a nested set of commands which: Fixes DNS resolution, sets the proxies, creates mount points, entries in fstab, sets PROMPT_COMMAND, sets the history file size, that sort of thing. Takes about a minute to configure after rebooting. Reply to Roger Whiteley Avatar dzhi 3rd February 2022, 11:21 am I’d suggest provisioning your systems with your custom Ansible playbook, works like a charm and saves a ton of time. Reply to dzhi Avatar JH B 2nd February 2022, 4:11 pm My database uses much ram…. (Influxdb) My server running the 64Bit Beta for a while 🚜 Reply to JH B Avatar Jeff Geerling 2nd February 2022, 6:01 pm Finally! This is exciting news, and while I’m guessing (like with the libcamera change recently) it will cause a bit of short-term strife for some users (especially on older boards), this is a great long-term improvement so many users don’t have to spend as much time trying to get newer software working on ancient 32-bit architectures. Thanks for the tireless work getting Pi OS to be as transparent to run on Raspberry Pis as possible. The efforts are often less appreciated, but go far in recommending Pis vs other SBCs. Reply to Jeff Geerling Avatar Steve 4th February 2022, 5:32 pm I took a look at the PiOs 64-bit and it works just fine out of the box. It even finds my household server automatically. The issue I have is that the drm fix for Netflix, etc., is a total flop. It doesn’t work. Period. I’d like to know when a fix will be universally available so that I can run streaming entertainment from the pi using Ubuntu. My current desktop, believe it or not, is a RPi4B-4GB in an Argonone M.2 case with a 240GB M.2 usb drive. I have it overclocked to a modest 1.8Ghz and like it so much that I’m writing this comment with it and use it as my daily desktop driver. One caveat about the M.2 is that it only loads correctly from the RPi Imager software using OSes that are part of the official library. Outside packages do not work, even though the Imager can load an out of library OS. Thanks for all you do and share! Cheers! Reply to Steve Avatar os2mac 2nd February 2022, 7:46 pm if this was just released today, why have the 64bit binaries on the download site say the last update is the 28th of January? Reply to os2mac Avatar Alan 3rd February 2022, 9:01 am Presumably just final QC after code freeze on 28/1, etc. I remember the same question being asked re bullseye release date vs blog. Reply to Alan Avatar AgrajagCO 2nd February 2022, 7:56 pm Gordon &amp; Team: Thank you so much for all your hard work to bring the 64 bit version to release! Reply to AgrajagCO Avatar Jozef Remen 2nd February 2022, 8:47 pm As a macOs user used to 64 bit I immediately used spare SSD to install 64 bit raspberry pi os Lite and then via KIAUH script klipper and fluiddpi. All went well and without any issues. I will copy all my klipper configs to 64 bit os tomorrow and will see how it goes with my Ender 5 Plus with SKR 1.4 board. Not that it worked bad previously, but heck, why not? Reply to Jozef Remen Avatar CJ 2nd February 2022, 8:48 pm I’ve been using the 64 bit beta of bullseye on my Pi4 8gb. Should I just update or do a fresh install? Reply to CJ Avatar rclark 2nd February 2022, 11:44 pm According to an above post. Apt update, apt upgrade gets you there. Reply to rclark Avatar CJ 2nd February 2022, 11:53 pm Thanks rclark. I’ll do both and let the group know. Reply to CJ Avatar MW 3rd February 2022, 5:02 am According to the Official Documents it should be: sudo apt update sudo apt full-upgrade The best feature of RPiOS ARM64 which is based of Debian Bullseye ARM64 (nothing to do with Raspbian whatsoever) is that Debian Backports are compatible. Reply to MW Avatar Ed 2nd February 2022, 9:25 pm This is a great step. One thing that was missing from the beta is Mathematica. Is that back for this release? Thanks. Reply to Ed Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 3rd February 2022, 6:33 am No, currently that is available on the 32-bit OS. Will ask about supporting 64-bit Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Ed 3rd February 2022, 11:46 am Thanks. I look very much forward to running that on the 64-bit OS. For me, it really is the main reason to install the desktop version of RPiOS instead of the Lite version. Reply to Ed Avatar Eric Olson 4th February 2022, 4:20 pm Mathematica is important to my use case and a major selling point in certain educational markets and others. Thanks for checking whether Mathematica can be made available on the 64-bit OS. It appears 64-bit is the way of the future desktop and it would be good to keep Mathematica. Reply to Eric Olson Avatar ZipperOS 2nd February 2022, 11:27 pm Ummm so when I tried to install it I cannot use multiple desktops (It immediately goes into an inescapable brown screen), I think this is to do with the weird new window manager. Can you please tell me how to use OpenBox and ignore using Mutter or whatever as it’s very annoying how the windows tear when you move them, as well as the desktop issue. Please respond, as I would LOVE to uses 64bit but cannot under this weird problem. Reply to ZipperOS Avatar ZipperOS 2nd February 2022, 11:28 pm I am also already using 32bit Bullseye with no problem at all WITHOUT the Mutter window thing. Reply to ZipperOS Avatar rclark 2nd February 2022, 11:41 pm I’ve been running the beta PI OS 64 since it became known. It has been solid for my playing around on a RPI4 4GB. Never crashed. Of course I run it headless and just SSH in and SFTP to transfer files. Currently it is running off a USB connected SSD. Nice to see PI OS 64bit finally released officially. I really don’t have a ‘need’ for 64bits other than using it to program in 64bit assembly for fun. I think, for now, I’ll just run it on my RPI4s and CM4 modules. Reply to rclark Avatar Jno 3rd February 2022, 12:08 am Coming from beta is an rpi-update recommended? Reply to Jno Avatar MW 3rd February 2022, 10:09 am https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#rpi-update Reply to MW Avatar K 3rd February 2022, 12:35 am Don’t forget that the later Raspberry Pi 2 (v1.2) uses the same CPU as the Raspberry Pi 3, only slightly downclocked. There’s no reason the Pi 2 v1.2 shouldn’t be able to run the 64 bit version (download page doesn’t list it as compatible). I’d test it, but all my 2s are v1.0, so the earlier chip listed above. Reply to K Avatar MW 3rd February 2022, 10:17 am Yes the version 1.2 does run ARM64 OSes, though I believe not many were sold and they utilise the original BCM2837 SoC.

Is wiringPi library compatible with it, i.e. works? I loosely remember that its author has given up on maintaining it, not recognizing 8GB RPI 4B for example. Reply to CooliPi Liz Upton Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 3rd February 2022, 11:18 am I’m afraid I don’t know; we don’t support it (it’s nothing to do with us; it’s a third-party library).

Reply to Ravi Joshi Avatar Vít Turčin 3rd February 2022, 2:54 pm Hello, it means that if I have a 64-bit version of Raspberry OS, I can download programs for Debian OHello, does this mean that if I have a 64-bit version of Raspberry OS, I can download programs for Debian OS 64-bit “for Arm64”? Reply to Vít Turčin Avatar MW 3rd February 2022, 4:55 pm Raspberry Pi ARM64 Operating System is based of Debian Bullseye ARM64 Operating System. Reply to MW Avatar Daniel 3rd February 2022, 4:11 pm This sounds great! Any chance that we can get an updated version of the Raspberry Pi OS for Desktop computers? Maybe a 64bit version? I like to use mine as a live USB for projects on the go but a 64bit option for me would make it better on some devices. Reply to Daniel Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 4th February 2022, 5:53 pm You should be able to open “Recommended Software” and install anything else you need from the Desktop version Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Ravi Joshi 3rd February 2022, 7:20 pm Thank You, Gordon, your team and Rpi for excellent work. I’ve been using 64bit Beta for almost two years now, and I like it. I needed 64 bit for lxc &amp; docker. Reply to Ravi Joshi Avatar Ed 3rd February 2022, 7:32 pm Not 100% sure this is 64-bit related (because directly from Debian instead of via Raspbian), or it’s Buster/Bullseye, but I had trouble getting my IQaudIO card working on the new 64-bit Lite release. Previous installations were all Buster where this didn’t pop up. Trouble is the vc4hdmi sound output is always enabled as the default output (card 0) despite disabling “dtoverlay=audio=on” in /boot/config.txt. I tried both commenting and changing to “off”. The solution is to comment out the KMS driver: “#dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d” and reboot, and then the sound HAT is the only remaining card. What are the other implications of disabling that vc4 line? For me nothing, I think, because I use this Pi headless. Is there a better solution to make the IQaudIO card the default (card 0) output? Thanks. Reply to Ed Avatar Gordon Hollingworth 4th February 2022, 5:55 pm Not the place for logging issues, please go to the github issues. This sounds kernel related, so github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Avatar Hector Gonzalez 3rd February 2022, 9:24 pm great news people, the difference in performance in noticeable, now what we need is better gpu performance and a opencl implementation for the pi. PLEASEEEEEEEEE Reply to Hector Gonzalez Avatar Rick M. 4th February 2022, 3:55 am I tried the 64-bit new version for a day, and I liked that it runs much faster, specially when installing applications. But a program that I use a lot (CubicSDR) runs better on the 32-bit version. Mainly “aesthetic” but nonetheless. For example, the frequency selector jumps in steps of two when you scroll with your mouse, and the fonts for the menues in the lower left corner (start/stop recording) are white on a light gray background, which are very difficult to read. With the 32-bit version I don’t have these problems. And one question: is it possible to get the kernel version and the debian version of the raspberry pi OS that I am using? Perhaps a terminal command for that? Thanks! Reply to Rick M. Avatar Ed 4th February 2022, 7:59 am uname -a cat /etc/debian_version Reply to Ed Avatar rick 4th February 2022, 8:04 pm Thank you, Ed. Very useful. Reply to rick Avatar Aeluvidu 4th February 2022, 8:12 am Yeah great decision ! , I’ve used the 64bit beta version with happiness since 2 years without any problems.(almost, only exception is that the picamera interface is not available in 64 bits) will it be now ? I’ve understood that the new lib-camera integration is done to be compatible with 64 bits version, right ? but now in bulls eye we can choose to activate the picamera interface back. will it be also the case with this 64bit official release ? I was always asking myself why the 64bits was not already official, because in many case I “feel” it faster ! And you can install so many cool things available only in 64 bits, Krita,.. I will test as fast as possible this official 64 bits release :-) Thank a lot for all the job done this last time it brings great improvements to the raspberry pi. Reply to Aeluvidu Avatar James Hughes 4th February 2022, 10:07 am No, the legacy camera application (and picamera) will not work on 64-bit. The reason that its taken a while to get a 64 bit version going is related – we needed to get all the libcamera and V4L2 code up and running first, as the legacy camera and playback stuff will not work on 64-bit. Reply to James Hughes Avatar Aeluvidu 4th February 2022, 10:18 am Thank you James for your answer, so I’m fixed. This is no problem indeed, I had already planned to invest time to master in the future the new lib-camera interface . And it will be ok when picamera2 will be out.

Reply to Andrew Avatar Eric Olson 4th February 2022, 4:27 pm I’m pretty sure the ability to run the 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS under a 64-bit kernel is unaffected by the release of a fully 64-bit operating system. In particular, support for running the 32-bit OS on top of the 64-bit kernel should continue for some time. Reply to Eric Olson Avatar stan423321 4th February 2022, 12:13 pm Hey there. Cool to hear you’re getting prepared for ARM making cores with only 64-bit support now. I was wondering about that 64-bit / 32-bit Chromium support. Putting aside it being a shame there’s no obvious way to have both installed at once, how does it work? Can we mix and match stuff?

Dale Reply to Dale Avatar e-raser 5th February 2022, 11:31 am I was waiting for this „64 bit RPi OS has exited beta stadium“ announcement for a long time – that’s a great message! Some applications I use or want to use need 64 bit OS, some even kicked support for 32 bit. To name a few: – Nextcloud News app – OnlyOffice app for Nextcloud – CollaboraOnline for Nextcloud – MediaDC app for Nextcloud And I saw a few other FOSS projects ending support for 32 bit OS the last year. As I use my current system since the installation back in 2013 (Squeeze -&gt; Wheezy -&gt; Jessie -&gt; Stretch -&gt; Buster -&gt; Bullseye) and never reinstalled it, I‘m now looking for a really good, meaning very detailed „migration guide“ to reinstall the OS based on x64. Reply to e-raser Avatar Irgendeiner 5th February 2022, 2:52 pm Apart for a few special cases the 32 Bit version is more powerful than 64 Bit.

Reply to Slasher006 Avatar Joanne Cunliffe 17th February 2022, 8:36 am The 64 bit version of RaspOS is fantastic! I’m using a Pi4 (8GB) as a file server/NAS/Samba/NFS/MythTV/Logitech Media Server connected to a Yottamaster 4 DAS (Directly Attached Storage) via USB 3. System is headless with OpenMediaVault as the ‘GUI’ (although I have the X11 libraries so I can run Synaptic and MythTV Setup via ssh -Y). I can max out the 100MB/s connection although it took a bit of tuning. RAID is SW via MDADM and boot is from an SSD via USB on the DAS. I will never go back to x86 for a small server! I just wish there were more powerful ARM or RISC-V based laptops (similar to Apple M1 – like Pinebook Pro but faster). Maybe RPi could go RISC-V in the future? Could we have a proper Mini or Pico-ATX carrier board (with ATX power connector to fit in Mini/Pico ATX case) for the CM4 with 4+ SATA ports for building NAS/Server systems? Anyway, fantastic job everyone and the Pi4 (8GB) is a fantastic little computer! Reply to Joanne Cunliffe Avatar bruce davidson 19th February 2022, 5:35 am My use case is replacing my ZenBook before my other, older intel-based laptop dies. Mostly, I write prose, code, browse the web, and consume media. So far, my rpi400 has been disappointing. But with the latest 64 bit OS, I’m seeing something I could realistically use. After using it for several days. I realized that I haven’t even enabled overclocking yet. I think this will work. On the other hand, the UX has really gone downhill. I am unable to configure the UI – some LXDE utilities don’t even launch. It is so bad, I would not agree that this is beta software. I would place it more pre-alpha. Reply to bruce davidson Avatar Nick Masters 26th February 2022, 3:28 pm Love having 64 bit. Have a, what is probably known, issue. Installed system. Set up the time, beforehand, for Indiana in the United States. Well, didn’t take place. Changed it on the system through the menu options and it still didn’t take place. Time was for Adak.

But what actually makes a distro? The packages it uses? The people who put those packages together? The philosophy behind the choices the people who put the packages together make? The question of what makes a distro is actually very difficult on to answer and it's about to get even more difficult. There's a change coming to the world of Linux that's potentially big enough to make us rethink what a distro is and how it works. That change is Ubuntu's Snap packages and the parallel effort dubbed Flatpaks. While these two projects differ in the details, for the purposes of this article I'll consider them the same thing and use the terms interchangeably. If you're even remotely up to speed with trends in server computing you'll have heard of containers. Snaps and Flatpaks are more or less the desktop versions. Whether a package is a Snap or Flatpak, there are few common things that make it significantly different than the packages your distro provides. For one thing, your distro doesn't provide it. A Snap package comes straight from the developer of the application itself. Your distro may put some Snap packages in its repositories so the installation experience may be the same, but behind the scenes the way Snaps are packaged, installed and run is very different. While there's still some polishing needed in most distros' current implementations of Snap packages that I've used, for the most part the experience from the user's point of view is pretty much the same as any other software. However, installing Snaps by searching your distro's repositories is probably the least interesting way to install them. Where Snaps and Flatpaks excel is applications outside your distribution's repos. Consider Firefox Developer Edition: very few, if any, distros have it available in their repos, which means if you want to run Mozilla's browser you'll have to install and manage it separately. There are a variety of ways to do this: Ubuntu has .deb files, Arch has the AUR, and you could always compile it yourself. The problem is that Firefox Developer Edition updates almost daily. Package maintainers – the people creating those .deb files or packaging them up for the AUR – have to update their packages. Install Firefox Developer Edition as a Flatpak package (currently that's unofficial, maintained by Fedora and Red Hat developers) and all of a sudden you're directly tied to Mozilla's updates. So far Mozilla hasn't produced an official Developer Edition Flatpak or Snap, but the company does plan to do it for Firefox itself and Snaps provide a means to switch to beta/dev &quot;channels&quot; of a packaged app. A Snap/Flatpak version of Firefox has two huge advantages over the distro-based version of Firefox. First, updates come faster from a single source, which makes for better security and eases distro package maintainers' workload. Second, Mozilla can continue to provide updates well past the point that Ubuntu or Fedora might want to. Faster updates and eliminating the distro middleman are just two advantages of Flatpaks, though. Perhaps the even bigger advantage – especially with software like web browsers – is the security sandboxing. Flatpaks/Snaps have much more limited access to your operating system than traditional apps. Sometimes this means not all features of an app are currently available in the Flatpak/Snap version, as is currently the case with the Snap version of LibreOffice, but as the platform matures expect those issues to be ironed out. So what's the current experience of using Flatpaks/Snaps like? I've been using the unofficial version of Firefox Developer Edition for quite some time now and am happy to report that it's much easier to update than even the AUR-based version I used previously. A single command that I put in a cron task updates my browser every night without me needing to every think about it. I always have the latest release and I don't have to do anything to get it. My only gripe is that the unofficial version requires installing a bunch of GNOME dependencies I don't otherwise need. I also run the Flatpak versions of LibreOffice, Inkscape and Blender. All three are indistinguishable from the distro versions I used previously. I don't need the features in LibreOffice that currently aren't supported in the Flatpak version so I don't have any issues there, but be sure to double check the known issues before you try it out. If they're indistinguishable from the distro versions, why bother? Well, since a lot of what I do with LibreOffice is open other people's documents, I like the sandboxing – which admittedly has some bugs, but is probably, at least under Wayland, more secure than a packaged version. The other reason I've embraced Flatpaks is I believe they're the future of Linux software distribution. While it's true that the history of computing is littered with examples of failed write-once, run-anywhere software, Flatpak and Snaps really aren't that. They do simplify developers' lives by making it easier to package apps independently of distros, but that's as far into the dangerous run-anywhere territory as they get. I don't think that distros will disappear as a result of Flatpaks/Snaps, but I do think that the division between rolling release distros like Arch and conservative distros like Debian will be less important. The kernel itself isn't going to be a Flatpak any time soon, but if you're using Arch for the reasons I am – to get the latest versions of Userland software in a sane way – then Flatpaks accomplish the same thing without the need to run bleeding-edge kernels. ® Get our Tech Resources Share Similar topics Firefox Red Hat Ubuntu More like these × Similar topics Firefox Red Hat Ubuntu Narrower topics CentOS Elementary OS Fedora OpenShift RHEL Broader topics Canonical Debian Mozilla Foundation Operating System Web Browser Similar topics Share 28 comment bubble on white COMMENTS Similar topics Firefox Red Hat Ubuntu More like these × Similar topics Firefox Red Hat Ubuntu Narrower topics CentOS Elementary OS Fedora OpenShift RHEL Broader topics Canonical Debian Mozilla Foundation Operating System Web Browser TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like By order of Canonical: Official Ubuntu flavors must stop including Flatpak by default You can add Snap's rival cross-distro packaging format back in yourself OSes23 days | 69 How to get the latest Linux kernel on your Ubuntu box And a choice of ways to get the latest KDE too, if that's your thing OSes12 days | 35 Fedora 38 will still support framebuffer X11 and NIS+ Next version of Red Hat's bleeding-edge distro won't drop all the older tech it had hoped to OSes17 days | 10 The quest for secure telco networks How ZTE’s cybersecurity assurance is designed to address regulatory complexities and minimize risks Sponsored Feature The Register icon Biting the hand that feeds IT About Us Contact us Advertise with us Who we are Our Websites The Next Platform DevClass Blocks and Files Your Privacy Cookies Policy Privacy Policy T's &amp; C's Situation Publishing Copyright.

                   NS1:content=" Skip to content Reviews from My Couch Facebook New Releases Movies Television Books Comic Books Zones Lists and Rankings Year in Review Site Info The 10 best short stories in ‘The X-Files: Trust No One’ (Book review) January 6, 2016April 16, 2021 John Hansen “The X-Files” returned to comics in 2013, it will return to the small-screen for six episodes starting on Jan. 24, and last year it returned to bookshelves with “Trust No One,” a collection of short stories published by IDW, which also produces the comics. With the exception of the “I Want to Believe” movie novelization in 2008, it marks the first “X-Files” book since a six-book run in during the show’s heyday in 1990s. These 15 stories are hit and miss; I’d recommend this collection for “X-Files” die-hards but not casual fans. As is often the case with books published by companies that don’t regularly publish books, it has a higher-than-usual percentage of typos and line-editing errors, although it’s not so bad as to render it unreadable. Many of the stories could’ve benefited from one more pass from a copy editor, and some of them needed a lot more work. Still, there are some valuable additions to the lore and some just-plain-fun monster yarns; some require the short-story format while others feel like rough outlines for a TV episode and actually suffer a bit in this format. Here are the 10 standout stories: 1. “Dusk” by Paul Crilley (set in 2015 in Castle Bluff, N.H.) – Crilley riffs on the “Twilight” craze with the thinly veiled stand-in of the “Dusk” novels, written by a recluse who hates his own books. Rumors that the “Dusk” vampire is real draw several teen girls to the area, many of whom go missing. It’s a fun commentary on shallow pop fiction. 2. “Back in El Paso, My Life Will Be Worthless” by Keith R.A. DeCandido (1994, El Paso, Texas) – DeCandido, who also showed great insight into the “Firefly” verse with his “Serenity” novelization, introduces the evocative Special Agent Jack Colt, who resists help from Mulder and Scully in investigating a serial-killing spree that continues after several suspects are locked up for the crimes. 3. “Paranormal Quest” by Ray Garton (1997, Bella Vista, Calif.) – Garton riffs on haunted-house reality shows by throwing in a twist where a person in the house, rather than the building itself, might be haunted. 4. “Statues” by Kevin J. Anderson (1995, Furnace Creek, Calif.) – Anderson, who also penned three 1990s “X-Files” novels, is great at painting an evocative picture, though not quite as good at surprising a reader. But the concept of people turning to stone would’ve made a great “X-Files” episode. 5. “The House on Hickory Hill” by Max Allan Collins (1997, Banewich, Mass.) – Similar to Garton’s story, Collins – who also wrote the “I Want to Believe” movie novelization, delves into the backstory of a haunted house. 6. “Oversight” by Aaron Rosenberg (1994, Washington, D.C.) – Early in the show’s run, Skinner’s motives were presented as a mystery; later, it became clear he was on the side of Mulder and Scully. Here, he battles an FBI auditor to keep the X-Files open while also investigating an X-File on his own. 11 bizarre oddities in the ‘Halloween’ saga Elsewhere on RFMC 11 bizarre oddities in the ‘Halloween’ saga 7. “The Beast of Little Hill” by Peter Clines (1995, Little Hill, Mo.) – It starts as a fun story of M&amp;S investigating two rival backwater museums showing alien remains encased in ice. Similar to that “Scooby Doo” episode with the Wooly Mammoth, the aliens might not be dead after all. 8. “Non Gratum Anus Rodentum” by Brian Keene (1994, Washington, D.C.) – Like “Oversight,” we get more insight into Skinner, as it turned out he experienced an X-File back in his Vietnam War days, although he didn’t totally realize it at the time. A quarter century later, the case resurfaces. 9. “Loving the Alien” by Stefan Petrucha (1997, South Carolina) – In a twist on the format, Petrucha – the primary writer of the 1990s Topps “X-Files” comics – tells the story in present tense and from Scully’s perspective. Similar to many Season 8 and 9 episodes, Mulder is central to the story without being in it much. 10. “Clair de Lune” by David Benton and W.D. Gagliani (1994, south of Ottawa) – The authors do a nice job illustrating the snowstorm our agents are stuck in, then do a twist on an old-fashioned werewolf story.

                   NS1:content=" Doctor Who: Top Ten Master Stories On Audio Friday, January 15, 2021 Moo listens to the Doctor’s best enemy. masters The year 2021 marks the fiftieth anniversary of Doctor Who’s greatest villain: The Master. This character has shown up time and time again throughout the show’s run and has charted a course for themselves as not just the Doctor’s greatest enemy but one of the best television villains of all time in general. Equally deserving of some celebration is the character’s role in the show’s expanded media. It’s surprising how sparingly the good people at Big Finish used the Master until the last half of the 2010s. Now multiple incarnations have spin-offs in their own right, but that hasn’t stopped each appearance feeling like an event in and of itself. So join me as I pick ten of their best. light%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bend 10. The Light at the End (2013) Big Finish’s release for the fiftieth anniversary was always going to feature the Master front and centre. It should go without saying really. Geoffrey Beevers is up against eight incarnations of the Doctor competing for attention, but he manages to rise above the noise and steal every scene he’s in. His plot in this one is perfectly in keeping with the character and that it takes not one but eight Doctors to come together to foil it shows how well he did this time round. A great showing for the character, proving once and for all why he’s the Doctor’s greatest foe. dominium 9. Dominion (2012) A contender for the single longest Big Finish release of all time, clocking in at roughly four hours, this one-off special has a lot to recommend. It’s not only a rare look at the Seventh Doctor after Ace’s departure, but also the debut for one of the best Masters of the lot: Alex MacQueen’s incarnation goes to great lengths in this instalment to make a terrific impression, taking on UNIT like his predecessors but going one better and seeking to conquer every universe at once, all while posing as a future Doctor. The real Doctor eventually sees through it, but not before plenty of damage has been done. missy 8. The Lumiat (2020) This starts off as a fairly standard runaround noteworthy only for featuring the Michelle Gomez Master as the lead character. It’s hard to explain what makes this one so good without spoiling it. Scroll down now if you don’t want to be spoiled. Still here? Good. So here’s the concept: All of Missy’s plots are being foiled by Time Lady do-gooder “Lumiat” (played to perfection by Gina McKee). Missy suspects that this is a future Doctor. She’s wrong. The Lumiat turns out to be Missy’s next incarnation, the one who tries to do good after the events of The Doctor Falls. This stealth multi-Master story results in an excellent character piece for them (and as a bonus it manages to patch over how Sacha Dhawan’s incarnation can exist and be the character that he is after the events of series ten). anti%2Bgenesis 7. Anti-Genesis (2019) There have been a fair few multi-Master stories recently, and that so many make this list is a testament to their quality. This one features the alternate universe “Unbound” version played by Mark Gatiss entering the prime universe because someone has prevented the Daleks’ genesis playing out the way it was supposed to. The person responsible for this mess is named Sorvad (I’ll let you work that one out) and is of course the Master’s Derek Jacobi incarnation. The story plays out like a shlocky b-movie with all the ham and cheese associated, and the two actors Gatiss and Jacobi clearly having the time of their lives. It’s an excellent experience as a result that comes highly recommended. masterful 6. Masterful (2021) There’s a lot going on in this recent offering. It marks the Big Finish debut for John Simm’s Master and the overall debut for Milo Parker in the role (who I pray we’ll hear more of in future). As well as both of them, there are tonnes of other incarnations present – just look at that cover art, what a joy it was to listen. I did worry that said art was misleading, but it was not at all. It's terrific to hear how discunctional they all are together. There’s no man or woman in a blue box coming along to save the day this time, explicitly killing her off before the story starts to set the stakes for how anything can happen, it’s entirely up to the Master to make things right (or not right, as the case may be). The story pairs off several of them and sends them to different settings: We have a colony spaceship, domestic bliss, and a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and they’re all fantastic. A truly wonderful showcase for all the different incarnations it features. (Overall Geoffrey Beevers and Milo Parker win.) masters%2Bbanner 5. And You Will Obey Me / Vampire of the Mind / The Two Masters (2016) I’ve cheated a little by grouping these three together, but this 2016 trilogy should be heard as a unit. It was very welcome in what was the first year without Doctor Who on TV since 2004 (excluding one underrated special and an even more underrated spin-off). For three months, Big Finish gave us a wonderful time. In the first story, the Fifth Doctor and Beevers’s Master have a surreal adventure. In the second one, we have MacQueen’s incarnation meet the Sixth Doctor in a delightful Pertwee throwback. It all comes to a head in The Two Masters, bringing both together in a story that is full of fan-pleasing moments as they do battle with the Seventh Doctor and win, literally destroying the entire universe, and it only escalates from there. While bringing two Masters together for the first time was the main selling point, the intricately plotted storyline for them is what keeps you invested and gives this trilogy plenty of re-listen value. i%2Bam%2Bthe%2Bmaster 4. I Am The Master (2018) I’m going to run out of words for how good Geoffrey Beevers is as the Master. This story shows his understanding of the character as he also takes on writing duties. With his pitch-perfect performance and expertly crafted script, he quite literally draws the listener into the story. It’s a Big Finish story that never pretends to be anything more than that, making use of the fact it’s made in a recording studio to enhance the storytelling. It’s nice to hear Big Finish taking advantage of the medium their stories are presented in to do something very unique with that set up, and having the Master use that to his advantage couldn’t be more perfect. Give this one a try and let Beevers literally enchant you with his ear worm as you hang on his every word. mastermind 3. Mastermind (2013) Though misleadingly listed as a Companion Chronicle, this story has none of the Doctor’s companions anywhere to be seen. It is in fact a character study for the Master. Not many stories in performed media have explored the Master’s ill-fated body-hopping period between the movie as Eric Roberts and his resurrection as Alex MacQueen, but this one nails that difficult brief. In this one we see the Master held captive in a UNIT base, and the story recounts his attempts to get the staff there (played by the stars of the TV Movie) to free him. As he narrates seemingly unrelated accounts of his body-jumping exploits you find yourself wondering where he’s going with it and what he’s planning. It’s a fantastic experience as we get an insight into how cunning the Master can be when coming is all he has left to rely on. callous 2. The Master of Callous (2018) When you see the cover art, you see Derek Jacobi and the Ood during the Time War. Your expectation is competent fan service. What you get is far far better. This is no epic, it’s not a Fate Of The Universe story, but what it is is much more interesting. It’s set entirely on a single desolate colony world where the governor is only interested in profit, the people feel downtrodden but can’t do anything about it, and wild Oods stalk the woods. Tensions are boiling, and then enter the Master. The slow burn might put off some listeners, but stick with it for the pay-off as the narrative comes to a conclusion on the final disc. It’s not an easy listen but well worth it. With troops marching the streets, with wild unpredictable Oods massing around them, and only one recently bereaved woman left who can see what’s happening, the resulting boxset is one of the most compelling pieces of storytelling that Big Finish have ever done – They very rarely come much better than this. master 1. Master (2003) The Master’s self-titled outing is one of the weirdest Doctor Who stories of all time. The story is set on a planet inspired by Edwardian England where one Dr. John Smith is being told of some horrible murders. When the Doctor crashes the situation, Smith starts wondering about his own past. It spirals from there as the Doctor explores with him what lies below the facade and slowly the Master begins to emerge, and then Death herself comes calling for a chat. This story feels very connected to the stories of the nineties VNA range, but stands entirely on its own as a piece of compelling experimental drama that takes some huge risks with potentially controversial reveals, getting away with it only because of a clever framing device. Thanks to phenomenal performances by Sylvester McCoy and Geoffrey Beevers, an incredible supporting cast, and a superb script by Joseph Lidster, this one is easily my choice for the best Master story from Big Finish and a serious contender for being their best overall as well. “Moo” is the pseudonym used by this Doctor Who fan. He can usually be found procrastinating by thinking about Doctor Who. Follow him on Twitter @z_p_moo for more of his unusual takes, but do so at your own risk.

                   NS1:content=" The Best Big Finish Doctor Who Stories For Newbies, Part 1 Monday, September 12, 2016 Tony exceeds the limit. big%2Bfinish There’s a general rule here at WarpedFactor: we try not to go beyond 1500 words per article, because, y’know, people have lives, and big as our egos are, we don’t want to take up too much of them at a time. Nevertheless, trying to prescribe a quick buyers guide to the best of the best on a by-Doctor basis is a tough one to do within the word-count, simply because there are so many red-hot must-buys to choose from, and so much to say about them. Bear with us on this one, and while everyone has their own ideas of what the best stories are, hopefully if you’re a newbie to Big Finish, this list won’t steer you actively wrong at any point. domain%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bvoord The First Doctor 1. Domain of the Voord The story with which Big Finish chose to kick off its Early Adventures range, Andrew ‘Full Circle’ Smith re-invented the Voord from The Keys of Marinus with a whole group psychology and a sense of Voord dignity and brutality that elevated them to proper scary villain status. 2. The Rocket Men Ian Chesterton narrates a thrilling story of thugs with jetpacks in the style of the 30s and 40s adventure serials, but the story is most notable for the questions it makes him ask and his realisation that Barbara is the person he really can’t live without. John Dorney kicks off a trilogy of Rocket Men stories with a combination of derring-do and emotional warmth that never disappoints. 3. The Time Museum A tricksy little number from James Goss that sees Ian unravelling his history in a kind of museum of time travel. Combines emotional weight with an example of why Chesterton was such a good companion, and also serves as an allegory of real-world degenerative disease. Heartbreaking but beautiful, The Time Museum will possibly make you cry, for both better and worse. 4. The Oliver Harper Trilogy Yes, technically this is a cheat. No, realistically, we don’t care. The First Doctor and Steven get a new recruit on board the Tardis, sixties city trader Oliver Harper. In three stories from Simon Guerrier (The Perpetual Bond, The Cold Equations and The First Wave), we see three important episodes from his life on board – how he proves himself worthy, the secret he’s been hiding, and the man that Oliver becomes thanks to his time with the Tardis crew. As well as creating a somewhat unlikely shipmate for the First Doctor, the three stories foreground the brilliance of Steven as strongly, doing double-duty in terms of their emotional weight. Plus they show us what is probably the Doctor’s first encounter with an on-screen enemy, and delivers them far more effectively than the TV version did. 5. The Flames of Cadiz Big Finish has proved itself excellent at delivering pure historicals, and the First Doctor has been particularly well served in that regard. The Flames of Cadiz though has a particular sense of that First Doctor trope of schlepping from place to place on urgent missions, being thought of as a spy by everyone and, for Ian Chesterton, the lesson that one should perhaps not always meet one’s heroes. It’s thrilling, compelling stuff despite the toing and froing, with well-written characters and complications from Marc Platt. Pick it up if you’re in the mood for a Marco Polo or an Aztecs, but want to be surprised by the new. black%2Bhole The Second Doctor 1. The Black Hole A very specifically pinpointed moment in the Second Doctor and Jamie’s history – both before and after The Two Doctors – this story from Simon Guerrier drips with 21st century thinking, while having an atmosphere and a scenario that’s pure Troughton. A black hole where one shouldn’t be possible, and a bunch of people who aren’t dead when they should be leads the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria to investigate. The surprise in this story mostly revolves around Rufus Hound, who immortalises a character that’s been due a run-in with the Second Doctor since the sixties. 2. The Second Doctor Companion Chronicles Box Set, Volume 1 Very much ‘The Jamie Box Set,’ this picks four stories from different stages in the Highlander’s life with the Doctor and shows his evolution over that time. Something creepy, something solidly sci-fi and 21st century relevant, something classically Troughton and something that takes that stolid Troughton era feel and advances it, there’s something here for every kind of Jamie fan. Add in Frazer Hines’ uncanny Second doctor impersonation, and input from fellow Tardis travellers across the Troughton era and you’ve got a set that you’ll go back to time and time again. 3. Lords of the Red Planet Genesis of the Ice Warriors. Need we say more? While sometimes feeling the limits of its toing and froing and the budget constraints that would have made it unfilmable in the sixties, Lords of the Red Planet answers questions you always wanted to know about the green-armoured reptiles from Mars. Unmissable stuff. 4. The Queen of Time Positively shudderworthy, this Lost Story is a companion piece to The Celestial Toymaker – another bored immortal, this time with a fascination for time and timepieces, sets the companions hoops to jump through as a way of pressurising the Doctor into staying with her forever. The imagery here is disturbing and bold and surreal, making the most of the audio landscape to scare the willies out of you – but in a way you’ll never find less than interesting. 5. The Forsaken Another Early Adventure, this one gives us some ‘Back To The Future’ action for Ben Jackson (as now played masterfully on audio by Eliott Chapman). There’s a clammy, creepy, Horror of Fang Rock vibe to the story though, as a troop of British Army squaddies find themselves trapped on an island off Singapore in 1942, with a band of inexplicable strangers from a blue box and something that’s picking them off. You’ll breathe out at the end of this one and realise how long you’ve been holding your breath. third%2Bdoctor%2Badventures The Third Doctor 1. The Last Post James Goss gives us a story of death-prediction and mechanical machinations in true Third Doctor style. Also highly notable for being told from Liz Shaw’s point of view, and giving some very welcome detail on Liz’s family background and relationships. The Last Post will leave you thinking ‘Well, I never knew that,’ and smiling, having been served a slice of vintage Shaw with a smattering of Third Doctor at the end. 2. The Third Doctor Adventures, Volume 1 A brave release this, having recast not just a companion but the third Doctor himself. Tim Treloar never entirely impersonates Jon Pertwee, but gives an uncanny sense of his presence throughout Prisoners of the Lake (ancient evil stirs beneath an archaeological dig) and The Havoc of Empires (interplanetary diplomacy gone more than a little awry). Really speaking if you’re a Third Doctor fan, you can’t get more evocative of the period than this. 3. The Many Deaths of Jo Grant A fascinating, disturbing story from Cavan Scott and Mark Wright that perfectly captures both the personality of Jo Grant, and the relationship between her and the Doctor. It’s an occasionally harrowing listen, but it proves its worth long before the end. 4. The Blue Tooth For those who still bemoan the lack of an on-screen adventure with the Third Doctor and the Cybermen (no, The Five Doctors doesn’t count), this is manna from Heaven. Another story mostly told from Liz Shaw’s point of view, it adds more backstory to her character, this time her college days, and delivers possibly the oddest Cyber-strategy in history (and that of course is really saying something). Nigel Fairs delivers a story that’s both bizarre and shocking while feeling entirely right for the period. One word of warning – if you hate dentists, try The Prisoner of Peladon by Mark Wright and Cavan Scott instead. 5. The Scorchies Earns its place on the list simply by virtue of creepy oddness. James Goss delivers homicidal puppets who have songs about world domination and killing people. Once heard, never forgotten – no matter how hard you try. philip%2Bhinchcliffe Fourth Doctor 1. The Darkness Of Glass Justin Richards delivers a story that has all the creepy Edwardian base under siege shocks of The Horror of Fang Rock, but with a very New Who shudder added to its make-up. Baker and Jameson, doing what Baker and Jameson do absolutely better than anyone else. 2. The Cloisters Of Terror Jonathan Morris pulls a fast one, delivering a story of a haunted university college, Liz Shaw’s mum, played again by the ever-superb Rowena Cooper, three ghostly nuns and a position of faith that keeps the rational world ticking over. Not so much terrifying as richly enjoyable and deliciously funny. One to go back to time and again. 3. The Wrath Of The Iceni A potentially peculiar one, being a Fourth Doctor pure historical, but John Dorney not only delivers a fascinating point in history and rich characterisation for those who play it out, but uses the figure of Boudicca of the Iceni as a figure to show Leela her own true nature – the call of vengeance appealing to her blood, but her time with the Doctor ultimately making her a stranger to the warrior queen’s thirst for blood. 4. Philip Hinchliffe Presents, Volume 1 Hinchliffe brought a very specific style to the Fourth Doctor’s time – a kind of joyfully gothic approach to scaring the pants off the young audience. The stories here – The Ghosts of Gralstead and The Devil’s Armada thrum with Hinchcliffe style, which, forty years after his time on Doctor Who, is an absolute thrill. 5. The Auntie Matter In a tight race between the Two Romanas, the first incarnation wins out over Wave of Destruction. The Auntie matter by Jonathan Morris is Doctor Who does PG Wodehouse, with robot valets, deadly aunts, and the Doctor and Romana both tracking down the same villain from entirely different directions. Farcical while still maintaining its darkness, The Auntie Matter will have you laughing and shuddering by turns. Best of the Best If you’re getting into Big Finish on a budget, and have to choose just one from each Doctor, go: 1. Domain of the Voord 2. The Black Hole 3. The Third Doctor Adventures, Vol 1 4. Philip Hinchcliffe Presents, Vol 1 Tony Fyler lives in a cave of wall-to-wall DVDs and Blu-Rays somewhere fairly nondescript in Wales, and never goes out to meet the &quot;Real People&quot;. Who, Torchwood, Sherlock, Blake, Treks, Star Wars, obscure stuff from the 70s and 80s and comedy from the dawn of time mean he never has to. By day, he runs an editing house, largely as an excuse not to have to work for a living. He's currently writing a Book. With Pages and everything.

Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) must prove Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) is legally a sentient lifeform with rights and freedoms under Federation law. Relevance: This was one of the few episodes that dealt with the issue that not everyone is comfortable with artificial lifeforms. In fact, a cyberneticist called Cmdr. Bruce Maddox (Brian Brophy) was the sole member of a Starfleet special admissions panel to oppose Data's admission to Starfleet Academy, on the basis that Data was not a sentient being. Datalore Lore was a fourth generation Soong android and Data was a fifth, but unlike Data, Lore picked up a flutter somewhere along the way.

Once there, they find his brother, Lore, and discover his true nature. Relevance: This is Lore's (played Brent Spiner, who appears in &quot;Picard&quot;) first appearance, which may turn out to be a significant plot point in &quot;Picard,&quot; also we get to learn a little about Dr. Noonian Soong (also played Brent Spiner), the creator of both Data and Lore.

However, the seriousness of this seemingly innocent act quickly attracts the attention of Starfleet, who wants to separate the child from Data and the Enterprise for study and analysis. Relevance: Another of the few episodes, along with &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; that dealt with the issues facing artificial life. This episode is also an excellent example of the growing relationship between Picard and Data. Sadly however, Lal suffers a total system failure as a result of a fault in her positronic brain.

In doing so, he becomes part of the collective – but is unusually given a name, Locutus – and the Borg has access to all of the Captain’s knowledge and experience. Relevance: We know the Borg play a significant part in &quot;Picard,&quot; as we’ve seen that Hugh (Jonathan Del Arco) returns as does Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) plus we’ve seen a Borg cube in the trailer.

Relevance: Another of the very best &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episodes, we see for the very first time the Picard vineyard, which we know features heavily in the new show. We also meet for the first time his brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp), his wife Marie (Samantha Eggar) and his nephew René (David Birkin).

Fearing he has defected, the Federation sends Picard on a covert mission to determine why. On Romulus, Picard and Data meet with Spock, who claims to be trying to reunite the Romulans and Vulcans. Meanwhile however, powers within the Romulan government attempt to pervert Spock’s mission and portray it as an invasion of the Federation. Relevance: Speculation that Romulans and Vulcans are related goes all the way back to &quot;The Original Series,&quot; but the idea is explored in much more detail in &quot;The Next Generation.&quot; But this excellent two-part episode gives us another insight into Romulan culture, which we know plays heavily in the new &quot;Picard&quot; show. I Borg Three of five, or Hugh, is the first Borg we see separated from the collective, something that happens more in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager.&quot; Three of five, or Hugh, is the first Borg we see separated from the collective, something that happens more in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager.&quot; (Image credit: CBS) Series: &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; Episode: &quot;I Borg&quot; (S05, E23) Premise: The crew of the Enterprise find a crashed Borg shuttlecraft and a lone survivor. Taking him up the ship, he is separated from the collective and begins to discover he has an individual identity. He even picks a name for himself, Hugh. Picard is ordered to plant a virus that will spread through the hive mind and could wipe out the Federation’s most lethal enemy. Instead however, he repairs Hugh and returns him to the crash site where he is recovered by the Borg. Relevance: We know Hugh makes a return in &quot;Picard&quot; so this episode is definitely essential viewing. We also know that returning Hugh to the collective had a damaging effect on the single mind mentality of the Borg as we saw later in &quot;Descent.&quot; Descent parts 1 &amp; 2 Data and Lore, both created by Dr. Noonian Soong, stand amongst Borg now separated from the collective. Data and Lore, both created by Dr. Noonian Soong, stand amongst Borg now separated from the collective. (Image credit: CBS) Series: &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; Episode: &quot;Descent&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2 (S06, E26 &amp; S07, E01) Premise: Data’s evil twin, Lore, stumbles upon the Borg ship that Hugh is on. His new sense of individuality has spread to everyone onboard and they’re in a state of disarray, not knowing how to function as a unit. Lore seizes this opportunity to rule them. The Enterprise is lured through a trans-warp conduit to an unnamed planet where they find Lore and his new Borg servants. However, not every Borg from Hugh’s ship has taken to Lore and an underground resistance movement exists. Relevance: Despite the Borg collective separating itself from Hugh’s ship, the damage done by giving him individuality was apparent. This is another important episode as it both concludes Hugh's origin story, but also sows the seeds of Borg evolution that we'd see more of in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager.&quot; All Good Things parts 1 &amp; 2 How much of Picard’s future that we saw in the series finale will also appear in the new show? How much of Picard's future that we saw in the series finale will also appear in the new show? (Image credit: CBS) Series: &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; Episode: &quot;All Good Things&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2 (S07, E25) Premise: The mischievous entity Q (John de Lancie) sends Picard travelling to and from three very specific time periods, past, present and future to solve a chicken and egg-style riddle about the destruction of all life in the galaxy. Relevance: We get to see what the future holds for Picard and the bridge crew of the Enterprise – but is it the real future, or just one crafted by Q as part of this new puzzle? We know Data doesn’t make it this far in the future because he was killed in the movie &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis.&quot; We learn Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) died in this future and will Picard actually develop Irumodic syndrome in the new show..? Scorpion parts 1 &amp; 2 Seven has a chance to speak freely to other beings that’ve been assimilated in a subconscious sanctuary called Unimatrix Zero. Seven was assimilated when she was just six-years old. Once rescued by the USS Voyager, she became an invaluable member of the crew. (Image credit: CBS) Series: &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; Episode: &quot;Scorpion&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2 (S03, E25 &amp; S04, E01) Premise: The USS Voyager flies through Borg space and encounters an alien race (designated by the Borg as species 8472) even more powerful than the Borg…and naturally determined to destroy all life in the galaxy. This leads Cpt. Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to form an alliance with the Borg in order to survive and ultimately defeat them. Relevance: This is the episode that first introduces us to the Borg drone Seven of Nine. Born Annika Hansen, she was the daughter of human exobiologists Magnus and Erin Hansen and assimilated by the Borg at the age of six. Seven was freed and joined the Voyager crew, ultimately returning to the Alpha Quadrant with them. Unimatrix Zero parts 1 &amp; 2 Seven has a chance to speak freely to other beings that've been assimilated in a subconscious sanctuary called Unimatrix Zero. Seven has a chance to speak freely to other beings that've been assimilated in a subconscious sanctuary called Unimatrix Zero. (Image credit: CBS) Series: &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; Episode: &quot;Unimatrix Zero&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2 (S06, E26 &amp; S07 E, 01) Premise: As Voyager approaches an alien outpost decimated by the Borg, Seven begins to dream vividly of an idyllic sanctuary, known as Unimatrix Zero, where Borg drones can gather subconsciously during their regeneration cycles. This represents a threat to the Borg collective in the Delta Quadrant that Janeway wants to exploit. Relevance: This another example of how the Borg were evolving in &quot;Star Trek&quot; storylines, moving on from the mindless automatons we saw in &quot;The Next Generation,&quot; they now included a queen and a place where Borg drones could gather and remember their lives before they were assimilated, Unimatrix Zero. Star Trek: Nemesis Despite the Romulan homeworld only playing a minor role in “Nemesis,” it was nice to see some of the architecture of the Imperial Senate structure. (Image credit: CBS) Movie: &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; Premise: Supposedly the Romulans want to negotiate a peace treaty, so the Enterprise is sent to their homeworld, Romulus. However, a coup d'état on Romulus brings a new praetor, Shinzon, to power. However, he’s not a Romulan, but a genetic copy of Jean-Luc Picard and he now plots to destroy the Federation once and for all. Relevance: Prior to &quot;Picard,&quot; &quot;Nemesis&quot; was the very last installment of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and we get a glimpse of the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, we see the marriage of Commander Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Deanna Troi plus the discovery of B-4 and the death of Data. Children of Mars The &quot;Short Trek&quot; entitled &quot;Children of Mars&quot; shows the sneak attack on Mars by a rogue group of synthetics The &quot;Short Trek&quot; entitled &quot;Children of Mars&quot; shows the sneak attack on Mars by a rogue group of synthetics (Image credit: CBS) Series: &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; Episode: &quot;Children of Mars&quot; (S02, E06) Premise: Two young children, whose parents are away working on Mars, clash spectacularly while at boarding school in San Francisco. The two girls are awaiting punishment when news of the attack on Mars breaks. In light of the devastation and the unknown fate of their parents, they put aside their differences in a touching moment of solidarity. Relevance: This is the first glimpse we get to see of the sneak attack on Mars by a rogue group of synthetics in 2384. An event that we've learrned plays a key role in &quot;Star Trek: Picard.&quot; Today's best Streaming TV services deals Amazon Prime Amazon Prime Video - Free Trial View at Amazon Prime Discovery+ Free Trial View at Discovery Communications Microsoft iTunes View at Microsoft US Honorable mentions The episode &quot;The Defector&quot; is the first of several in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; that show Romulan mentality and the secretive nature of their culture. A defector from the Romulan Empire claims to have vital information concerning a renewed Romulan offensive against the Federation and seeks asylum aboard the Enterprise, but Picard has suspicions over whether his claims are genuine. The defector, Setal, (James Sloyan) turns out to be Alidar Jarok, the commander responsible for the massacre at the Norkan outposts. The augments story arc in the vastly underrated series &quot;Enterprise&quot; should definitely get a mention as the talented Brent Spiner plays Arik Soong, the brilliant-but-bonkers father of Dr. Noonian Soong, the scientist who designed and built Data. This three episode-long plot brilliantly links Soong to Khan Noonien Singh (from the “TOS” episode “Space Seed” and the movie “The Wrath of Khan”) and the Eugenics Wars and shows how Arik Soong gave up trying to enhance humans and began instead for the first time to focus on artificial intelligence. Finally, we probably should mention the 2009 J.J. Abrams reboot &quot;Star Trek&quot; even though we’re not particularly big fans of his contributions to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. This was the first time we heard about Romulus being destroyed by the supernova of 2387. Ambassador Spock used a MacGuffin red matter to create a black hole that would consume the star's energy. However, before he could complete his mission, the supernova reached Romulus, destroying the planet. Among those killed were the family of Nero, who swore revenge against Spock, Vulcan and the Federation for allowing his world to die. During their initial confrontation, both the ships of Spock and Nero were pulled into the newly created black hole, sending them back in time and resulting in the creation of the alternate reality, known as the Kelvin Timeline. Whether or not this is mentioned in detail in “Picard” remains to be seen.

Firefox handles lots of tabs better than Chrome in my opinion as it displays a scroll bar instead of blank unidentifiable tabs. Chrome suffers from phantom tabs as well if you open too many as new tabs are not displayed anymore in the browser's tab bar once you reach the maximum threshold. Still, tab management suffers the more webpages you open in the Firefox web browser. Management is not the only thing that is affected negatively. The more tabs you open the more memory Firefox uses; may not be a problem if you have 32 Gigabytes of RAM but if the device has 4 Gigabytes or less, you may run into memory issues and as a cause of that increased page file use and slow downs. Tab Stash is not the first Firefox extension to introduce tab saving options.Â Extensions like Set Aside, Session Boss, or Sleep Mode offer similar functionality. Tab Stash tab stash firefoxtab stash firefox Tab Stash introduces a new feature to the Firefox browser that mitigates the issues. It may save all open tabs in a Firefox window to a stash using Firefox's bookmarking system. Imagine you have twenty tabs open in the Firefox web browser and don't need this for the moment anymore. Maybe you started to notice that free RAM is way down and want to free memory up. A click on the Tab Stash icon in the Firefox toolbar saves all open tabs to a new stash. The tabs are hidden and then unloaded in the process and memory is freed as a consequence. Apart from pushing all open tabs to a new stash, it is possible to do so for individual tabs instead.Â Pinned tabs are excluded from the process. Tab groups saved by the extension may be accessed in Firefox's sidebar or on a new management page. Just right-click on the extension icon and select either option to do so. All tab stashes are listed with date and time, and the titles and favicons of the sites. A click on any listed tab opens it in a new tab in the Firefox browser window without deleting it from the stash. Icons are provided to open and delete individual tabs or all tabs of a stash group, to add all open tabs or the active tab to the selected stash, or to delete a stash without opening any of the listed tabs. The extension supports drag and drop operations to move tabs from one group to another, rename to rename groups, and search functionality to find tabs quickly. Tab Stash Options tab stash optionstab stash options Tab Stash features two options which you may access on about:addons when you select the extension. The first option defines whether the extension opens the sidebar listing or tab listing when saving new tabs to a stash. The second option handles memory management. Tab Stash hides tabs but keeps them loaded in the background for a while by default. The extension unloads tabs automatically after a while of inactivity. You may change that to unload tabs immediately when they are stashed or to close tabs immediately. Closing Words Tab Stash is a useful browser extension for the Firefox web browser. It works well and improves memory usage when you use it. The extension lacks support for a whitelist to block certain sites from being added to a stash. While you can pin some to protect them from being stashed away, an option to exclude others without pinning them would probably be useful. All in all though a good extension for the Firefox web browser.

John Connor said on June 3, 2019 at 10:46 pm Reply So it’s OneTab? The only visible difference I can see is that it uses the sidebar. Maybe the internals are different but the overall functionality is the same as OneTab. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/ John Connor said on June 4, 2019 at 12:21 am Reply I’ve been playing with TabStash and it is very much like OneTab except better. As far as I can tell, it implements all of the features of OneTab, plus a few more. I like that it opens in the sidebar (or a new tab) whereas OneTab only opens in a new tab. Also, OneTab is closed source. TabStash is open source and provides everything GitHub. As a long time OneTab user, I can tell you that I’m switching to TabStash. Expert said on June 4, 2019 at 11:28 am Reply 1. does it work on Firefox mobile (I used to use one extension that stopped working)? 2. does it have ability to export/import opened tab – in case there was factory reset of the phone and one would like to open all those 200+ tabs back? Thanks Martin Brinkmann said on June 4, 2019 at 11:36 am Reply I don’t know if it works on Firefox Mobile but you can restore saved stashes easily with just a click.

Stackpole）和已故的阿龙·奥尔斯顿（Aaron Allston）联合创作。两位作家的风格略有差异。斯塔克波尔的文字铿锵有力，犹如战斗檄文，爱国主义情怀和对自由的热爱跃然纸上；奥尔斯顿是冷幽默高手，细节设置得十分巧妙，几乎每一页都能戳中星战迷的笑点。 在这十本小说中，我最喜欢的是第九本《X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar》。它是一个相对独立的故事，与其它九本关系不大。这是一本向《三个火枪手》致敬的作品，因此文字相当讲究，华丽而不艰涩，风趣而不粗俗。读完以后令人拍案叫绝，大呼过瘾。 这套小说在国外星战迷中间评价极高，不亚于《索龙三部曲》。而且，一直有国外星战迷呼吁把这套小说改编为科幻美剧。因为它的总体格局确实很有很多美剧的特点：主要角色以固定的团队为单位与外部世界互动，每个角色都有不为人知的过去，这些过去可能会对其他人产生影响，团队不同成员间也有不同的情谊和关系。 是否有配套漫画：有，而且漫画是小说的前传，部分汉化。 阅读前需要看什么作品：正传三部曲电影即可。 是否有简体中文版：无，其中有一本有繁体中文版，但翻译得不好。 5、《新绝地武士团》（The New Jedi Order）系列小说 上图是《新绝地武士团》第一册的封面。《新绝地武士团》系列创造了星战小说两个“之最”，至今没有被打破： 1、包含册数最多的系列，共有19本长篇小说、3本中篇小说和3篇短篇小说； 2、篇幅最长的单本星战小说，即《The New Jedi Order: Star by Star》，厚达624页！ 《新绝地武士团》翻开了星战宇宙最黑暗的一页：河外文明 遇战疯人（Yuuzhan Vong） 入侵银河系，掀起惨烈的遇战疯人战争。这场战争虽然以遇战疯人的失败而告终，但导致银河首都科洛桑面目全非，银河同盟被迫临时迁都，已知空间的累积死亡人数达365万亿，一百多个星系被彻底摧毁。 《新绝地武士团》是卢卡斯影业第一次尝试在公司的指导下，让多位作家集体协商创作一套庞大的星战衍生宇宙系列作品。单独地来看，《新绝地武士团》系列是质量非常高的太空军事科幻作品，远非过往的衍生宇宙作品所能比。其设定自洽合理，情节精彩曲折，人物栩栩如生，让读者第一次切身体会到星战世界的宏大与深邃。但是，由于作品本身的背景和风格过于黑暗，因此它在庞大的星战传奇中显得有些违和（星战世界还没发生过如此大规模和残酷的外星人入侵事件）。这导致《新绝地武士团》成为争议最大的星战作品之一。 我本人为这套小说写了详细的剧情介绍： 遇战疯人战争简史 。 是否有配套漫画：无。 阅读前需要看什么作品：最好把《索龙三部曲》和《X翼》系列小说看一看。 是否有简体中文版：部分中篇小说和短篇小说有汉化。 6、《原力传承》（Legacy of the Force）系列小说 《原力传承》系列小说总共有九本，上图只是其中第一本的封面。《原力传承》讲述了第二次银河内战与 杰森·索洛（Jacen Solo） 堕落为西斯尊主达斯·凯杜斯的故事。 这套小说是卢卡斯影业尝试将前传三部曲电影的风格融入《绝地归来》后的衍生宇宙的一次努力。应该说，这次努力还是相当成功的。第二次银河内战几乎就是克隆人战争和银河内战的结合与重演。杰森的悲剧也很像阿纳金·天行者的命运。 我本人为这套小说写了详细的剧情介绍： 第二次银河内战简史 。 是否有配套漫画：无。 阅读前需要看什么作品：最好把《新绝地武士团》系列小说看一看。 是否有简体中文版：无。 7、《绝地的命运》（Fate of the Jedi）系列小说 《绝地的命运》系列小说总共有九本，上图只是其中第一本的封面。《绝地的命运》原创了两个新的反派——西斯的失落部落和上古原力使用者阿贝洛思（Abeloth）。小说的主线就是讲银河同盟和新绝地武士团如何打败他们的故事。这个系列在最后将主线直接与正史动画片《克隆人战争》衔接，让人耳目一新。这个系列有两大特点： 1、最初的几本类似《星际迷航》，偏重于对银河系神秘文明的探索； 2、跟其它星战作品在政治上的复古风不同，这个系列在政治上显得很“现代”，比如利益集团控制下的媒体造假、政客通过引导社会舆论达到自己的目的、示威游行引起的政权更迭（颜色革命？）、法庭内外控辩双方律师的斗智斗勇等。 我本人为这套小说写了剧情简介： 阿贝洛思败退前后银河系局势概述 。 是否有配套漫画：无。 阅读前需要看什么作品：最好把《原力传承》系列小说看一看。 是否有简体中文版：无。 8、《西斯的失落部落：故事合集》（Lost Tribe of the Sith: The Collected Stories） @耗子爱啪啪 提到了《基地》三部曲，其实，在星战小说界，也有一本《基地》风格的小说，那就是《西斯的失落部落：故事合集》。这本小说本身是《绝地的命运》的衍生，讲述了西斯的失落部落在几千年前的起源。这本小说最大的特色就是仿照《基地》三部曲的写法，用一系列离散的小故事和一条单一的线索讲述一个文明几百年的发展史。 是否有配套漫画：有，而且漫画是小说的续集。 阅读前需要看什么作品：最好把《绝地传奇》（Tales of the Jedi）系列漫画和《绝地的命运》系列小说看一看。 是否有简体中文版：无。 最后，我以《西斯的失落部落：故事合集》为例，介绍一下星战衍生宇宙作品的错综复杂： 1、《西斯的失落部落：故事合集》是《绝地的命运》的外传； 2、《西斯的失落部落：故事合集》第一个故事讲到主角的飞船与另一艘飞船相撞，这被撞的另一艘飞船引申出了小说 《横流》（Crosscurrent） 与 《激流》（Riptide） 。 3、《横流》与《激流》的主角源自游戏《绝地学院》（Jedi Academy）。 4、上面提到的飞船相撞事故发生在超空间大战（Great Hyperspace War）时期，超空间大战记载在漫画《绝地传奇》里。 5、漫画《Lost Tribe of the Sith: Spiral》是《西斯的失落部落：故事合集》的续集，也是一个离散的小故事。 6、《Lost Tribe of the Sith: Spiral》里的反派来自漫画《旧共和国武士》（Knights of the Old Republic）。 7、漫画《旧共和国武士》是游戏《旧共和国武士》的前传。 看了上面的介绍，我相信题主会意识到，想按顺序完整阅读星战小说几乎是不可能的~~ ----------------------------------2015年3月8日------------------------------------- 我就说星球大战吧。 1，应该从哪个系列或者哪几本书看起？ 答：这是 《星球大战》作品概述 ，你可以先把其中列出的“正史”小说看掉。不多，就那么几本。然后可以读“传说”作品里的《索龙三部曲》（Thrawn Trilogy）——它虽然不是第一套星战衍生小说，却为日后庞大的星战衍生小说打下了基础，所以我们一般都推荐星战新人从《索龙三部曲》开始读。而且这套书今年应该会有简体中文版出版，由我们 星球大战中文网 审定。 2，有没有完整的阅读顺序图？ 答：没有，不过这里有一份 按作品内时间线编排的所有星战小说列表 ，你可以以此为参考。 3，书籍有没有包括影视作品本身的主线剧情，还是全部都是前传外传后传射门的。 答：当然有电影小说版。不过主要都是电影的前传、外传和后传，毕竟把电影故事用文字复述一遍意义不大。同样，电影小说版简体中文版今年应该会再版，由我们 星球大战中文网 审定。 4，这些书里，名气最大成就最高的有哪些？ 答：还是《索龙三部曲》，它 入选NPR最受欢迎的100套科幻/奇幻小说 ，名列第88位，是唯一入选的星战小说。除了《索龙三部曲》，我个人比较喜欢的其它小说包括《向莱娅公主求婚》（The Courtship of Princess Leia）、《X翼》（X-Wing）系列小说（共十本）、《新绝地武士团》（New Jedi Order）系列小说（共十九本）、原力传承（Legacy of the Force）系列小说（共九本）和《绝地的命运》（Fate of the Jedi）系列小说（共九本）。 编辑于 2015-03-14 23:54 " />

As the premiere for Star Trek: Picard draws closer, we’ve recapped some key episodes and movies to watch to get caught up on the character’s journey. With seven seasons and four films, Picard has grown and changed over the course of his career as captain. There are so many key moments that shape him into the man he is, but we’ve selected a few important moments that drive him in the beginning of his newest adventure. From Picard’s psychology to his encounters with the Borg to the role Data played on the Enterprise, here are the key moments to remember as he returns to our screens. We’ve grouped them into different categories — Picard as a character, the Borg, Data, and Romulans — but you can choose to watch them in any order you’d like.

Embed Code Restart WATCH: Catch Up on These Episodes Before Star Trek: Picard A Crash Course on Jean-Luc Picard Star Trek: The Next Generation, “Family” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;Family&quot; &quot;Family&quot; StarTrek.com In the wake of being captured and absorbed into the Borg Collective in the season three finale and season four premiere, Picard returns home on shore leave for the first time in almost 20 years. The trauma of the Borg’s torture weighs heavily on Picard, even as he claims he is alright. While most of his family greets him warmly, Picard’s brother is cold towards him due to their differing outlooks on technology and the future. Ultimately, they are able to reconcile, but not before Picard has to confront his own trauma. At one point, Picard talks to his friend Louis about how while he was happy his family kept traditions alive, he wasn’t bound to those traditions. Louis replies that Picard always reached for the future. We know that Picard has returned to his family’s vineyard, so what drove him to abandon the future in pursuit of the past? That might be a mystery left for the pilot of Picard, but this is an excellent episode for fans to get a feel for Picard’s psychology and deepen the mystery of what could have made him leave Starfleet.

Tragedy struck the Picard family in the movie Star Trek: Generations, during which Picard finds out that his brother and nephew have died in a fire. Picard is now the last of his family, and without him, there is no one to keep the traditions alive. This is yet another tragedy for the captain, and sets up the groundwork for his ultimate return to the family vineyard. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The Drumhead” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;The Drumhead&quot; &quot;The Drumhead&quot; StarTrek.com After the warp drive is damaged and Romulan interference is suspected, retired Admiral Norah Satie is brought on to find who on the Enterprise could be a spy. Despite finding a Klingon officer who is leaking information, it is revealed that the supposed sabotage was in fact a simple malfunction and not an attack. Satie is unsatisfied, though, and begins a fanatical hunt to find a traitor on the Enterprise, much to Picard’s dismay. This is an episode that showcases Picard’s strong sense of justice. He says he will not treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to do so, and he stands tall in defense of his crew and himself. Picard is firm, but he stands for the scales of justice in the universe being balanced. He will not allow anyone to remove due process or to play judge and jury. We can assume that Picard’s innate sense of righteousness and justice will come into play as he faces the Romulans in their newly imperiled state in Picard, because one of the reasons Picard is such a powerful character is that he will do the right thing to ensure that justice is served, not revenge Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The First Duty” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;The First Duty&quot; &quot;The First Duty&quot; StarTrek.com Picard imparts an important lesson to young Wesley Crusher in this episode. When Wesley’s squadron suffers an accident that costs a cadet his life, it is revealed the squadron was attempting a banned maneuver. Ultimately, Wesley reveals the truth at a hearing to uncover what happens, and Picard’s trust in him is restored. Picard comforts Wesley and says that while the immediate future will be hard, ultimately he will have respect and trust from his fellow students again, even if Wesley doubts this. Picard has unwavering faith in his crew and his family, including Wesley. When that trust is broken, he does not immediately berate Wesley and cut him out of his family but offers him a chance to fix his mistakes. His offer of a way to mend this broken trust shows the empathetic side of the captain, and his unshakable trust in those he cares for. Picard, even with his stern nature, has always been incredibly kind and loyal to his own crew. This is what makes him such a strong captain, and reminds us why so many are willing to follow him into the jaws of death. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode: “The Inner Light” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;The Inner Light&quot; &quot;The Inner Light&quot; StarTrek.com In one of the best hours of Trek from any series, Picard finds himself living a whole new life in a dreamlike state. On the planet Kataan, Picard is now known as Kamin, a regular man with a wife and a family. Twenty minutes pass as the Enterprise crew tries to revive their captain, but during that short period of time Picard lives an entire lifetime on the dying world, experiencing the planet’s culture and world even as it enters its final years. It is revealed that the inhabitants of the planet sent the probe into so that someone, “a teacher,” could learn about them and remember them following their planet’s demise. The probe found Picard, and so he carries with him a civilization that has been dead a thousand years. It’s a deeply moving episode that sets up the idea of Picard as someone who carries the legacy of those who have come before inside of him. If you need a reminder of Picard’s capacity for empathy and compassion, this is the perfect example. Besides, it’s a phenomenal episode in the Trek canon, and worth a revisit just to be reminded of the highest of highs from the franchise. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episodes “Chain of Command, Part I and II” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;Chain of Command, Part II&quot; &quot;Chain of Command, Part II&quot; StarTrek.com While on a secret mission to destroy a Cardassian biological weapon, Picard is captured and tortured both physically and psychologically by a ruthless military leader. While he is ultimately saved, he privately admits to counselor Deanna Troi that he was at his breaking point by the time of his release and was willing to do anything to get the torture to stop, even if he was rescued before he had the chance to break under the strain. Picard has endured many traumas in his life and his time as the captain of the Enterprise, but it is important that he admits his own humanity in these moments. Weakness is not a failure, not to him, and he allows himself moments where he can be human rather than a stalwart captain. If Picard can survive and endure, then we can all take lessons from him that we can also endure our own personal traumas. Picard survives, no matter what. We, the viewers, can all survive as well. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Tapestry” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;Tapestry&quot; &quot;Tapestry&quot; StarTrek.com After an attack during a mission, Picard is sent into cardiac arrest as his artificial heart is put under strain. When he “dies” from his wounds, he runs into old friend Q, who gives him the chance to relive the events that led to him receiving an artificial heart. These events would have led to his survival during that particular mission, but he would not have become the captain of the Enterprise due to an aversion to risk. Picard declares he’d rather die as captain than live as no one. Q returns him to his timeline, where he survives and reflects on his experience. Q tells Picard that his near death experience as a cadet taught him about his mortality and how life is too short to play it safe. This led to Picard being the man he is during the events of Next Generation and the ensuing films. Picard knows that his life is too brief to waste it by doing nothing. He must take action, which makes his new profession in Picard so interesting. There is nothing wasteful about returning to his family’s vineyard, but it is not as risky or remarkable as his time as captain. Could Picard see something that challenges his worldview in the beginning of the upcoming series? What could happen that could make Picard choose a safer path? And is it even a safer path, or is there a secret behind Picard’s newfound quiet life? Star Trek: Insurrection Star Trek: Insurrection Star Trek: Insurrection StarTrek.com In the third film featuring the Next Generation crew, Picard discovers a plot by the Son’a people to forcibly relocate the peaceful Ba’ku people so they can exploit their planet for its rejuvenating properties; the process would poison the planet with radiation, rendering it unlivable. Picard ultimately stops the Son’a from harvesting the planet which leads to the Ba’ku forgiving the Son’a and reuniting their people. When Picard finds out that the Federation is involved with the Son’a’s plot, he does not stand by. Instead he fights for what he feels is ultimately right. We know that Picard is not above disobeying orders and fighting for the little guy when he knows it is right, which is key to both his character and to the philosophy of Star Trek in general. When faced with his new challenges in Picard, will our captain once more have to rebel against Starfleet? We know he leaves his role as admiral, which points to a philosophical break between the two. Picard’s inner sense of right and wrong is key to his character, and I can’t wait to see what drives him to both leave Starfleet and, later, return to the stars. Learn to Love The Borg Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episodes “The Best of Both Worlds, Part I and II” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;The Best of Both Worlds, Part I&quot; &quot;The Best of Both Worlds, Part I&quot; StarTrek.com In this harrowing season finale, Picard is captured by the Borg and turned into Locutus, mouthpiece for the Borg army. The Enterprise faces a horrible choice: fire upon the Borg ship and destroy their captain, or allow the Borg to continue traveling towards Earth. Riker, acting as captain, makes the choice to fire on the ship… but thankfully, the Borg are undamaged and the crew has a second chance to save their captain. Picard is ultimately rescued and returned to his human state, but at great cost to his mind and body. The torture he underwent with the Borg was immense, and it deeply impacted the character and his relationship with the Borg going forward. As one of his archenemies, the Borg might have exacted the greatest personal toll from him. And yet, Picard remains the steadfast leader he has always been. It just takes some healing, as we saw in the episode “Family.” Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode: “I, Borg” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;I, Borg&quot; &quot;I, Borg&quot; StarTrek.com Picard faces off against the Borg again when the away team discovers an injured Borg drone on an icy planet. When Dr. Crusher is unable to stand by and let the drone die, Picard allows her to bring him on board. When he learns that he has the chance to use their prisoner to end the Borg threat, ultimately Picard chooses to let the newly named Hugh live, rather than destroy the entire Collective. This episode presents Picard with a difficult philosophical question. Is all fair in the battle against the Borg? Is an individual to blame for all the sins the Borg have committed? When encountering Hugh, Picard’s assumptions about the Borg are challenged, and in doing so Picard becomes a stronger, better leader. It shows his willingness to find the humanity in all he meets, even if he is facing off against an enemy that has never extended him or his crew the same grace. This is particularly important in the wake of “The Best of Both Worlds,” during which the Borg tortured Picard. The Borg were more than willing to destroy Picard for their own gains, but he is not willing to exact revenge in a manner that would be both cruel and unusual. This marks Picard’s humanity, and his compassionate nature. He is tough, but never cruel, and that is what makes him stand out as a character. Star Trek: First Contact Star Trek: First Contact Star Trek: First Contact StarTrek.com With the Borg headed for Earth, Picard is drawn back into the fray against this treacherous enemy. The Borg travel back in time to prevent first contact between humans and Vulcans and assimilate the planet, but the Enterprise, along with a couple intrepid new friends, are able to stop them by neutralizing their threat. While most of the Borg still exist in the future, the Borg Queen is taken out, alongside her ship. The Borg are complicated and fascinating villains, and it will be interesting to see how they are featured in Picard. As with many characters, Picard ventures beyond the end of the known timeline to explore the future of Starfleet. Have the Borg recovered their power to try and take over the universe again, or are they now refugees and scattered survivors? Again, these are the questions we’ll have to wait to answer. Star Trek: Voyager, Episode “The Raven” Star Trek: Voyager - &quot;The Raven&quot; &quot;The Raven&quot; StarTrek.com The only Voyager episode on our list, this episode focuses on Seven of Nine, who will be making an appearance in Star Trek: Picard. Recently freed from the Borg Collective, she is trying to learn once more to be human. She ultimately discovers her parent's ship, the Raven, which she was assimilated on when the Borg captured her and her family years before. When Janeway, at the end of the episode, offers to give her records of her parents, she says that she'll read them one day. Seven of Nine is a beloved character, and this episode highlights her nuance and complexity. It also highlights the tragic nature of her life. Assimilation isn't easy, and her struggle to become human again shows her courage. What will she be like when Picard runs into her out in the universe? We can only wait to see. Getting to Know Data Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Datalore” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;Datalore&quot; &quot;Datalore&quot; StarTrek.com In one of the first episodes to highlight Data and his brother, Lore, “Datalore” features Brent Spiner playing both androids. It also serves as an origin story, as it explains where Data came from and who made him. While Lore is a decidedly evil creation, Data serves as a figure of good. Lore says he is the second and more “perfect” model, he’s lying and is envious of Data being the second and improved creation. This episode drew praise for Spiner’s performance, and it highlights not only Data’s loyalty to the crew but the goodness seemingly coded into his being. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The Measure of a Man” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; StarTrek.com The debate over Data’s personhood rages on in this episode, as the crew engages in a debate over whether or not Data is a person or if he is property of Starfleet. When a Starfleet officer wants to experiment on Data, Riker is forced to argue against Data’s personhood, though ultimately Data and Picard are able to prove that Data is a sentient being and therefore entitled to the autonomy of making his own choices. This is a key episode in Data’s story. He is more than a machine used by Starfleet, but instead is a deeply human character, even if he is an android. Data displays the human trait of forgiveness both towards the officer who wanted to experiment on him and towards Riker, who deeply regrets his role in the proceedings. To paraphrase Captain Kirk, of all the souls Picard and the Enterprise met on their journeys, Data’s might be the most human. Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Brothers” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;Brothers&quot; &quot;Brothers&quot; StarTrek.com Lore and Dr. Noonien Soong, Data’s creator, are both back in this episode that once more highlight’s Data’s humanity. Both Data and Lore are recalled to Soong's deathbed, where he intends to give Data a chip that allows him to experience emotions. However, Lore deceives Soong and is able to receive the chip instead. Data apologizes for not being able to grieve his creator's loss and returns to the Enterprise, where he reflects on what has happened. Data's quest for emotions is key to his character, and this episode highlights this journey. While Lore ultimately gets the chip, Data remains the more human of the two brothers. Even without a chip to experience emotions, Data can still be empathetic to a degree his brother cannot. Everything You Need to Know About Romulans Star Trek: The Next Generation, “The Defector” Star Trek: The Next Generation - &quot;The Defector&quot; &quot;The Defector&quot; StarTrek.com Picard tries to help a Romulan admiral defecting from the Empire in this episode. Admiral Jarok makes the choice to never see his family again to help the Federation; ultimately, his defection is used by the Romulans to stage a trap for the Enterprise. Though Jarok kills himself, Picard is left with a note for Jarok's family and the knowledge that some Romulans have the courage to push back against the Romulan Empire. This is a key episode for Romulan-Federation relationships, and establishes that while Picard isn't the biggest fan of the Romulans, he respects them. Given the pending destruction of the Romulan homeworld, this is incredibly important. After all, Picard will be faced with the decision to extend his hand to help the Romulans, even after fighting with them in various episodes. That is the mark of a truly good captain. Star Trek: Nemesis Star Trek: Nemesis Star Trek: Nemesis StarTrek.com Picard faces off against the Romulan leader Shinzon in Nemesis, who has staged a coup of the Romulan government and who says he wants peace with the Federation, but who secretly plots their demise. Shinzon is a clone of Picard, originally created by the Romulans to plant a spy in the Federation, but was abandoned on the planet Remus to die instead. When Shinzon attempts to eradicate all life on Earth, ultimately two Romulan ships attempt to aid the Enterprise in stopping him, not wanting to be associated with Shinzon’s schemes. Picard is able to defeat his clone and foil his plot, but it is Data who makes the ultimate sacrifice by staying on Shinzon’s ship to ultimately destroy it and die in the process. The crew parts ways, with Riker heading to negotiate peace with the Romulans on the USS Titan. Picard discovers that Data has implanted his neural networks on another android, B-4, which means that he can ultimately return. This was, until now, the end of the story of Picard and his crew. We know that Data will return, and so will other crew members. It is still a high note to end on, even with Data’s loss; after all, the Federation might find peace with their longtime enemy. However, a threat was looming in the universe that no one could have prepared for, one that will lead into the coming story... Star Trek (2009) Star Trek (2009) Star Trek (2009) StarTrek.com The JJ Abrams helmed film sets up one of the key plots in Star Trek: Picard. The film reveals that the Romulan homeworld is destroyed by a star going supernova. While Ambassador Spock was able to save the rest of the universe, he was unable to save the planet, and in turn he created a black hole that swallowed his ship as well as a Romulan mining craft bent on revenge. While the majority of the galaxy was saved, Spock and the Romulan ship were sent careening into a different timeline. That marked the end of what we call the Prime Timeline prior to the end of the second season of Star Trek: Discovery. Picard takes place in the Prime Timeline after the destruction of Romulus and the forced relocation of the Romulan people. Given that Picard had tangled with the Romulans throughout The Next Generation and some of the cast’s films, this sets up an interesting dynamic. Can the Admiral make peace with one of his greatest enemies at their darkest hour?

                   NS1:content=" Linux For Old Laptops: The 4 Best Linux Distros To Try User by Derrik Diener Calendar Oct 5, 2017 Comment No Comments Everyone has an old PC lying around at home that isn’t being used. It’s too old to run the latest version of Mac OSX or Windows, so the machine collects dust. It doesn’t have to be that way. Instead, consider running a lightweight version of Linux on it. It’ll allow your old PC to experience new features as if it were brand new. In fact, there are projects dedicated to developing Linux for old laptops. That’s why in this list we’re going to go over the top 4 best Linux distributions to run on old, aging hardware. They work just as well on desktops provided the desktop meets the system requirements. We’ll go over what the system requirements are, why you should these distros out, their features, and more! 1. Lubuntu Lubuntu is an operating system built on top of the Ubuntu operating system, with a twist: instead of a heave desktop environment like Gnome Shell, users get the LXDE desktop environment. This is a desktop environment that is best used on low-end hardware. To be clear: Lubuntu isn’t the only Linux distribution out there that ships with the LXDE environment. In fact, there are a lot of Linuxes out there that profess to do what Lubuntu does. Many turn to this desktop for this reason: it can run on anything. The desktop, and programs under the hood in this Linux distribution allow it to run on computers with as little as 128 megabytes! It does a great job of helping Linux users on limited hardware experience a modern desktop. Users that install Lubuntu can expect a beautiful desktop, and a slick suite of applications (just like any other version of Ubuntu). In addition, users get snaps, and an unparalleled software selection. If you’ve got an old Laptop or Desktop sitting around with 512 MB of ram or less, this is a great choice. 2. Arch Linux Saying “Arch Linux” to a new Linux user can be scary. This is due to the fact that Arch Linux has a reputation of “being hard”. The reality is that it’s no more (or less) difficult than using any Linux distribution. The difference is that it requires some tinkering. If you can get past this, Arch Linux is pretty much perfect for old hardware. Why? Users build Arch. This means that you can look over your old PC, and make a decision as to what you’ll put on it. Do you have 1 GB of RAM? Maybe install XFCE or Mate. Only 256MB or less? LXDE, i3, AwesomeWM or Openbox will work. Suffice it to say, because of customization, it’s very easy to build an extremely lightweight desktop environment that will run like a dream on even the oldest machines. Additionally, Arch Linux is a “bleeding edge” distribution. This means that Arch will always get updates, forever. No need to re-format every 6 months for the latest software. Instead, users are given direct software updates, and the absolutely newest stable Linux kernel. For old PCs this is great, as each Linux kernel release improves driver support, performance and etc. If you don’t mind a little tinkering, Arch Linux is a great choice for aging hardware! 3. Bunsen Labs Bunsen Labs is the spiritual successor to the lightweight Linux distribution “Crunchbang Linux”. The Crunchbang project focused mainly on making an operating system that ran light on its feet, even on older hardware. This operating system offers up a lot of the same features that users of Crunchbang have come to expect, such as a custom, lightweight Openbox desktop environment with a Tint2 panel, and a Debian base. Other features include “unifying themes” that help make GTK2 and GTK3 themes match up, multimedia codecs, and an easy out of the box experience. When it comes down to it, Bunsen Labs is a great experience, and one that is all its own. It’s custom Openbox desktop environment may look unorthodox, and may take some getting used to, but you’ll quickly learn to love it. It is because of this desktop and robust, stable Debian foundation that Bunsen Labs is a perfect choice for aging hardware. 4. Puppy Linux The Puppy Linux distribution is a special one. The operating system runs on pretty much anything. Back in the day, Puppy could be found on USB thumb drives, due to it’s small footprint. These days, it’s used like any other Linux distribution. Unlike other Linuxes on this list, Puppy has many different bases. From Slackware-based, to Debian-based, to Ubuntu-based. The choices are endless. It is because of this choice, Puppy Linux belongs on this list. Not only does it work great on older machines (due to it’s lightweight desktop environment choices), but its variety ensures that there’s an operating system out there for everyone. The killer feature for Puppy isn’t even its “choices”, though. It’s the fact that it can run directly from the RAM on a PC, and not the hard drive. This means if your old PC’s hard drive is incredibly slow, it’ll still run fast! Additionally, the operating system is less than 150 MB, meaning it’ll load incredibly fast! It might not be Ubuntu, or Arch, but if you give it a chance, Puppy will make your old PC feel like new! Learn more about it here. Conclusion When it comes to aging hardware, Linux is king. With it, an aging PC can become a brand new Samba server, or a child’s first laptop, a living-room TV appliance and etc. The possibilities are endless.

                   NS1:content=" 《星际迷航》系列小说应该从哪里看起？ 周末下载了一些星战和ST的小说，星战有300多本，好几个系列，ST有800多本，好几个系列 能穷尽看完当然最好，但是我想请教同好们几个问题 1，应该从… 关注者 768 被浏览 65,327 查看全部 8 个回答 微尘如念 微尘如念 伪真相和真脑洞 【多图预警】 我是来推书的。推书范围限于ST的The Original Series（目前只看过这一系列的小说），不能很全面地回答题主的问题，但难得看到问ST小说的题目，不推不快，所以就这样不太全面地回答了，希望有所帮助。 推书之前，还是简单说一下前几个问题。依然只针对ST，不过TOS之外的其他系列也基本适用。 1，应该从哪个系列或者哪几本书看起？ 一个不太严谨的说法：顾名思义，当然从原初系列（The Original Series）看起。 TOS不是全部的ST，但没有TOS就没有ST。 之所以不太严谨是因为：1）从时间线来讲，最前面的其实不是TOS而是ENT（Enterprise），虽然ENT为后拍，也许理解为前传更合适；2）其实ST的系列之间没有那么强的连续性，基本不需要先看一个系列才能看懂另一个系列；3）当一个基本只看只喜欢TOS的人跟你推荐TOS……你还是得靠自己判断的…… 不过不管你从哪一个系列看起，内部的顺序还是建议“电视剧→电影（如果有的话）→小说”，毕竟在ST系列中电视剧和电影是官方承认的正史，同人小说嘛该算是是野史+演义。比如懂一点三国正史再去看三国演义，往往会发现更多有意思的梗，且能保持自身历史观的纯洁，道理同此。 （重启的电影11、12虽然有官方授权，但不是同一个宇宙里发生的事情，所以我一直也是拿来当同人看的……） 2，有没有完整的阅读顺序图？ 目前只在网上看到一张图囊括了TNG，DS9，Voyager，Enterprise几个系列的所谓“Reading Order”（偏偏没有TOS……唉）： The Trek Collective: Trek-lit reading order 。不过主要依据应该也就是Timeline，也另有网友整理过文字版的小说Timeline： maplenet.net 。 读ST小说还有一种顺序，就是按编号，我真地看到过有Trekkie说自己是按编号一本本看下来的（所以中间难免遇到质量不太过关的书，把他逼出来给差评），不过我觉得这种做法强迫症的原因可能更多，没什么道理。ST系列的小说编号是按照出版顺序来的，跟时间线无关，而且后出版的书也并没有义务参照之前出版的书（除非是续集），只要参照正史就可以了。两部小说完全可以针对同一事件提出矛盾的解释。 所以，我觉得不论编号顺序还是时间线顺序，其实都没有什么意义。再说有几个人真能把好几百本都看完的？ 3，书籍有没有包括影视作品本身的主线剧情，还是全部都是前传外传后传什么的？ 都有。剧集改编、动画改编、电影改编、前传、后传、外传……甚至正史里的一个“bug”就可以衍生一部小说。（比如克林贡人在最初TOS剧集中长得与地球人无异，后来电影里随着化妆技术和成本的改善，就变成那副凸脑门的形象……于是，衍生了一部小说解释克林贡人变身的秘密，Trekkie们的脑洞果然强大） 这里只推荐第一部电影的小说，虽然我不敢保证故事是最好的，同名电影也向来被喷得比较惨……但作者是ST的创造者Gene Roddenberry！这本书可算不是正史胜似正史，尤其对电视剧到电影之间空白时期的解释绝对是研究ST的宝贵史料（扯远了……），有中文版。 不过总体来讲，（个人感觉）没有太大必要去看剧集电影的改编小说，如果非要看文字（比如为了学英语），我倒是觉得不如读剧本，国外网友也整理出了全部的剧本： Star Trek Transcripts （这个网站上你能找到ST所有系列，还有Doctor Who）。 4，这些书里，名气最大成就最高的有哪些？ 到推书的部分了。以下推的基本都是TOS系列里口碑好评分高的，因为我自己选书看的时候也是先找了不少“Best Star Trek Novels”之类的推荐文章，还有参考Goodreads上的评分书评，所以算是有一定的客观性。另一个标准，推的都是我看过且自己觉得比较有意思的，因此也有一定的主观性。 （封面图面引自Goodreads，每本书加了此站链接，这个网站类似于国外的豆瓣读书，方便看国外网友的书评。） 1. Federation by Judith Reeves-Stevens 如果让我给trekkie推荐一本ST小说的话，那一定是Federation，推荐给non-trekkie之前会稍微犹豫一下，毕竟不了解ST的背景，看这本书会比较累。其实这本书不是纯TOS，而是一个crossover，阵容TOS+TNG，还有发明曲速引擎的Zefram Cochrane担任重要角色，书中把TOS和TNG的故事交叉进行。涉及Time Travel，到最后两边的Enterprise船员会有“互动”的，不过互动方式不是简单穿越，而是真正的“跨时代的合作”……不能剧透了。 总之，有技术，有想象，有故事，有情怀，Goodreads上评分近4，可见一斑。 2. The Entropy Effect by Vonda N. McIntyre (The Original Series #2) 让我专门给推荐给non-trekkie推荐一本ST，倒很有可能是这一本。因为我可以很形象地描述它：Spock版的《蝴蝶效应》。对的，比较传统的Time Travel小说，无论书名还是主题都跟后来的电影《蝴蝶效应》蛮相像的。不过请注意，论起发行时间来The Entropy Effect可比The Butterfly Effect早了20多年呢。（这真地只是只是巧合吗？）科幻方面自然也更硬一些，毕竟这是ST。 3. Uhura's Song by Janet Kagan (Star Trek: The Original Series #21) 又一本评价很高的书。名为Uhura's Song，其实主角不是Uhura，依然Kirk&amp;Spock，还有一个原创角色，是个略有点玛丽苏的女医生，不过没苏到令人讨厌的地步。这本书是讲文化差异的，有人类学的感觉。看多了星战类、阴谋类、时间旅行类，这本书还是让人感觉很清新的。 4. Doctor's Orders by Diane Duane (The Original Series #50) 终于轮到Doctor McCoy拯救世界了。好吧，有点夸张，只是“the doctor in command”而已。不过这也很难得，很……不正常了，好吗？主线是对新星球新文明的探索，对外星生物的设计相当新奇。 有星战情节，尤其是考虑到坐在舰长椅子上的是向来最“感情用事”的McCoy医生，这就很有意思了。 5. Spock Must Die! (Star Trek Adventures, #1) by James Blish Bantam Books novels可能是最早的ST小说系列，而这本书是系列第一本，也是我看的第一本ST小说。网上评分不算很高，但也有人大力推荐。话说这本书有多有意思呢？大概就是2×Spock的级别，没错，所谓“ Spock Must Die ”的意思是为了星舰的团结稳定，在这种情况下必须要执行“2Spock - Spock = Spock啦”，问题在于哪个是减数，哪个是差？ 这个可够Kirk舰长费心的了。 最后关于Klingon问题的结局，让人忍不住会心一笑。当然这不是正史，不过写这本书的时候那些正史还没有影呢。 另外传说中的Spock名言“A difference which makes no difference is no difference”，其实是在这本书里出现的。 6. Prime Directive (Star Trek: Worlds in Collision, #2) by Judith Reeves-Stevens 这本书不得不推一下，因为评价、地位、地位口碑都是TOS小说里首屈一指的。不过说实话，我倒没有很喜欢这本书，觉得前半部情节的设计有些牵强，舰长他们也被逼得太悲惨了一些……本书的价值在于对最高指导原则（Prime Directive）以及违反后果的思考。 这里还是要说明一下TOS时代的Prime Directive还没有TNG里设计得那么细致明确，以致Kirk舰长有过几次疑似违反PD的行为，但其实大量实例证明，舰长本质上还是Prime Directive的坚定遵守和忠实维护者 （绝对不是新时间线里稀里糊涂违反了PD还满不在乎隐瞒不报的那位）。 7. The Rings of Time by Greg Cox 链接： goodreads.com 这本书比较新（2012年出版），被谈论得相对少些。不过我还是想把它挤进第一批里来推荐。类型跟第一本推荐的Federation有点像，涉及之前电视剧里的某位重要历史人物。Time Travel元素再次出现，不过这次居然是……“魂穿”。不过总体还是硬科幻风格，情节设计也很棒。 8. Yesterday's Son (Star Trek: The Yesterday Saga, #1) by A.C. Crispin (The Original Series #11) 5年任务里比较靠后的故事。评分很不错。爆点仍然在Spock，而且居然是Spock发现自己在5000年前有了一个……私生子。这个故事可以弥补Spock在正史里没做过父亲的遗憾，Spock的儿子Zar也颇为惹人怜爱啊，不过Time Travel相关的故事往往逃脱不了宿命的纠缠…… 9. Time for Yesterday (Star Trek: The Yesterday Saga, #2) by A.C. Crispin (The Original Series #39) 上一本书的续集，已经是多年之后的故事了。Spock的父爱在上一本里还颇为含蓄，这一本中终于完全爆发。主线剧情扩展到整个宇宙的存亡问题，仍然是个跟时间相关的故事，the Guardian of Forever的秘密将最终揭开。 10. The Vulcan Academy Murders by Jean Lorrah (The Original Series #20) ST的小说有各种类型，这本是侦探类的。“无所不能”的Kirk舰长这次化身星际神探，调查一桩匪夷所思的连环杀人案。“犯罪”与“瓦肯”似乎是2个不兼容的词（所有不少小说才喜欢把它们联系在一起吧），且看舰长层层抽丝剥茧…… 对Spock家庭感兴趣的一定要看一下这一本，Sarek的戏份尤其不错。 编辑于 2017-06-30 09:40 " />

                   NS1:content=" Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Shortcuts User by Fatima Wahab Calendar Nov 3, 2014 Comment 9 Comments Following up on our post about Windows 10 shortcuts for snapping windows, we decided to explore one of the more exciting features in Windows 10, the virtual desktops. Windows is great when it comes to keyboard shortcuts so rest assured if someone were to go out hunting for a list of shortcuts for any feature, they won’t be disappointed. So far as the Technical Preview of Windows 10 is concerned, we’ve found four helpful shortcuts that let you switch to the next or previous desktop from the current one, close a virtual desktop, open a new virtual desktop, or select the next or previous desktop when you have the multi-task view open. Switch To Next/Previous Desktop Windows + Ctrl + Left / Right Arrow Key: Switching between virtual desktops from a desktop isn’t triggered by hotcorners or active hotspots on your screen like it is in OS X. To switch to the next or previous desktop from the current one without going through the multi-task view, hit Windows + Ctrl + left / Right arrow key. switching-desktops Close Current Desktop Windows + Ctrl + F4: You can close a desktop without having to open the multip-task view. This shortcut closes the current desktop and will switch you over to the next one. It also closes the apps you currently have open on that desktop. close-current-desktop Open New Virtual Desktop Windows + Ctrl + D: You don’t have to open the multi-task view to create a new desktop. Where Windows + D will minimize all windows and take you to your current desktop, adding the Ctrl modifier and using Windows + Ctrl + D will open a new desktop and switch you to it. new-desktop Select Next / Previous Desktop In Multi-task View Windows + Tab, Tab, Left / Right Arrow Key: This shortcut is actually executed in three steps.

                   NS1:content=" The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels - IGN The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels Share. The Dark Knight returns to stock your bookshelf with good reads. By Joshua Yehl and Hilary Goldstein It's Batman's 75th anniversary! To celebrate, we are updating our list of the 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels. Batman has more graphic novels than any other hero, so there were many, many stories read in order to compile this list. It's worth noting that this is an update of former IGN Comics Editor Hilary Goldstein's list from 2011. Choice additions and subtractions were made to the list, as well as a change-up in the order -- including a brand new #1. With Grant Morrison finishing his epic run on Batman, we entered his most lasting addition to the Batman mythos -- Batman and Son -- to the list. Also added were Batman: The Black Mirror by Scott Snyder, Jock, and Francesco Francavilla and Batman: Earth One by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank, but you'll have to check out the list to see where they landed. Sorry, still no Batman: Mad Love by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm; it’s a great story but more notable for its Harley Quinn material than Batman. Snyder and Greg Capullo are currently doing a fantastic job with their Batman run, but we are waiting until they are completely done before considering any of their work for this list. There were dozens of other noteworthy Batman graphic novels that were considered, but in the end, this is our list of the 25 Batman stories every comics fan should read. Our Criteria When making our selections, it became necessary to set up some ground rules. After all, Batman's adventures go beyond his own books. Do we count the JLA? What about something like Robin: Year One? Books were weighed against four criteria. Format - Though we call this list &quot;The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels,&quot; it's in a loose sense. Prestige format books (such as The Killing Joke), graphic novels (Son of the Demon) and trade paperbacks (Tales of the Demon) are all eligible. A Batman Story - Batman needs to be involved in the story as a vital character. We love books such as Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood and Batman: Birth of the Demon, but these great tales are origins of other characters that scarcely utilize the Dark Knight. A JLA or any other story is eligible, provided Batman is in the lead role. A Good Read - Sometimes too much importance is placed on the significance of a story rather than the quality of the storytelling. A story needs to be compelling beyond just the plot twists. Indelible Mark - Great stories are unforgettable. It's not enough just to be a good read, each of these books must linger in our memories. Every book on this list has stayed with us even after the last page was read. These are books you tell people, &quot;You just have to read this, if not your life will have less meaning.&quot; 25 Batman: Earth One by Geoff Johns &amp; Gary Frank If Batman: Year One were written today, it would be Batman: Earth One. It’s a modern retelling of Batman’s early years where he’s not an infallible master detective who moves like a shadow -- a point driven home when, while chasing a crook over the city rooftops, his grappling gun malfunctions and he lands in a pile of trash below. Also, instead of being best buds with Jim Gordon, he winds up socking him in the face. The crucial element that makes this story work is the overhaul of Alfred Pennyworth’s character. No longer a kindly butler, Alfred is an ex-MI-6 agent who, instead of serving him tea and tending to his wounds, beats the crap out of Bruce to teach him a lesson. It’s a refreshing spin on the classic dynamic that lets us appreciate how Batman would adapt to a world with more realistic limitations. 24 Batman: Nine Lives by Dean Motter &amp; Michael Lark Who killed Selina Kyle? That's what private detective Dick Grayson and the mysterious Batman hope to discover. These two might be partners in another universe, but in Nine Lives, Grayson doesn't care much for the Batman and the Batman, well, he doesn't care much for anyone. Noir is a natural fit for Batman villains. Joker becomes a two-bit card shark, Harvey Dent a two-faced lawyer, the Penguin a mob boss, and Mr. Freeze a stone cold hitman. The fun noir twists on Batman's Rogues Gallery is great, but Grayson's the one who shines here. He has never been as visceral, fun, and interesting as he is here. 23 Batman: The Man Who Laughs by Ed Brubaker &amp; Doug Mahnke A mad man is targeting Gotham's elite and next on his hit list is millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. This is Batman's introduction to his most nefarious villain, the Joker. Where Alan Moore's The Killing Joke tells the origin of the Clown Prince of Crime, The Man Who Laughs details the first tussle between Joker and Batman. Brubaker is one of the best crime writers in comics. He manages to bring some of that noir flair to The Man Who Laughs while maintaining the proper tone and pace for a good Batman yarn. To my knowledge this is the only story to ever suggest that, like Bruce Wayne, the Joker had to practice to perfect his art. And that's ultimately what makes the Joker so frightening. His psychosis is not chaotic, not as random as you might think. There's a methodology and a purposefulness to many of his actions. 22 Batman: Venom by Dennis O'Neil, Trevor Von Eeden &amp; Russell Braun Venom opens with one of the biggest failures in Batman's career. A little girl is trapped. Drowning. And Batman isn't strong enough to save her. Distraught, the Dark Knight finds a new alternative to strength training -- a little pill that triples his strength. Of course, it's highly addictive and the always-in-control hero loses his grip, nearly assassinating Jim Gordon just to get his fix. It's a look at a side of Batman we rarely see. Venom is one of those stories that is a struggle to rank. The premise is stronger than the actual writing. Batman fights a shark. So, there's that. But there are moments, strong moments, where O'Neil tests the limits of Batman's commitment to his crusade. And it's enough to make Venom one of the more memorable Batman stories ever told. 21 Batman: Thrillkiller by Howard Chaykin &amp; Dan Brereton During a time of political and social turmoil, the citizens of Gotham put their hopes on the city's Dynamic Duo to maintain order. Only this time it’s Batgirl and Robin. Set in the early '60s, this Elseworlds story imagines the Joker as a hot babe, Bruce Wayne as a reluctant hero, and Barbara Gordon as a tormented crusader of vengeance. As if that weren't enough, there's a really awkward sex scene between Bruce Wayne and Black Canary. Thrillkiller takes familiar characters and nudges them slightly to the left, creating surprises at nearly every turn of the page. No Gotham City denizen is quite their true selves here, but none are so far removed as to be unbelievable. What that really means is that you have a story that offers a fresh take on the Batman mythos. It still feels new even after nearly 15 years. Page 2 Of 3 Continued from Page 1 20 Batman: A Death in the Family by Jim Starlin &amp; Jim Aparo Though the ending is known and the story feels a little old fashioned, A Death in the Family is still powerful decades later. This is how the second Robin met his end at the hand of the Joker. Jason Todd was a jerk. Let's get that out there right now. Anyone who read stories with him dressed in red and yellow knows he was not a great Robin. But his death feels undeserved. It seems wrong, even though the ending to this story never changes. And maybe that's what makes it remain memorable, more than 20 years later. The image of a lifeless Robin cradled in Batman's arms still gives me goose bumps. 19 Batman and the Monster Men by Matt Wagner A year into his crime-fighting career, Batman has only faced mobsters, thugs, and a few crazies. Monster Men is Batman's first encounter with anything super-human. Hugo Strange is creating monstrous creatures, stronger than the Dark Knight and with a mindless thirst for blood. Now, Batman must adapt to a new kind of villain. This is the moment where Batman goes from street legend onto the path of superhero. The best Batman books push the Caped Crusader to his limits. This story is about Bruce Wayne learning he has limits. 18 Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying by Marv Wolfman, George Perez, Jim Aparo &amp; Tom Grummett Dick Grayson and Jason Todd became Robin out of circumstance. They didn't really choose the role, it was chosen for them. Tim Drake is different. He takes an active role in becoming the third Robin. A Lonely Place of Dying isn't just an origin tale of Robin #3, it's the best response to the question: &quot;Why does Batman need Robin?&quot; The answer, it turns out, isn't to keep Batman from the dark side or as some subconscious way of restoring Bruce Wayne's lost youth. When Batman has to consider the safety of a young sidekick, he's more likely to think things through. He'll take more precautions. He'll be safer. Robin, just by virtue of being at his side, keeps Batman alive a little longer. Now, if that doesn't make you want to read the only worthwhile Robin origin, you just don't like Batman stories. 17 Batman: Strange Apparitions by Steve Englehart, Len Wein, Marshall Rogers &amp; Walt Simonson If you haven't read Strange Apparitions, chances are you've never heard of Bruce Wayne's best love interest, Silver St. Cloud. She's smart enough to deduce Batman's true identity and strong enough to break the Batman's heart. And that's just part of the mix in this great tale from the late '70s featuring underappreciated lunatic Hugo Strange (back from the dead) and the Joker (creating more dead). Plus, as a bonus, you get to see Hugo Strange dressed as Batman. Batman: Year One gets a little too much credit for &quot;reinventing Batman.&quot; The truth is that there were great Batman stories before Year One. This is the best you'll find from the pre-Year One era that's been collected in a TPB. And it serves as a worthwhile introduction to Hugo Strange. 16 Batman: Gothic by Grant Morrison &amp; Klaus Janson Where did Bruce Wayne go to school? We know about Wayne's training to become the Batman, but in Gothic, we get a glimpse into Bruce Wayne's life before his parents were murdered. This ties into a series of grisly murders in Batman's early days in the cape and cowl. Gothic is a detective story, a horror story, and a thriller that teams Morrison with the great Klaus Janson. Religion and Batman aren't married in comics as often as they should be. Morrison plays it perfectly. For those a little worried about a &quot;Morrison head-trip,&quot; relax. Nothing in these pages will damage your brain… too much. 15 Batman: Knightfall by Various Artists and Writers [Editor’s Note: For the purposes of this list, Knightfall is referring to all three parts of the “KnightSaga” -- Knightfall, Knightquest, and KnightEnd. Yes, we are including three graphic novels in one entry. Give us a break on this one!] Knightfall is an example of a story that overcomes the shortcomings of its art and writing, which were flawed if only because of several change-ups over its publication. The story is so essential to Batman’s character that it was the main inspiration for The Dark Knight Rises movie, further expanding its popularity and cementing it as a classic. In Knightfall, Bane breaks out all of Arkham Asylum’s criminals to exhaust Batman, and then once he’s worn out, he breaks his back over his knee. Ouch. What follows next is why the story made this list. Batman hands over the mantle to Jean-Paul Valley aka Azreal, who soon loses his mind and starts killing criminals. Batman must train and rebuild himself from the ground up with help from Lady Shiva, and then he returns to Gotham to reclaim his mantle from Azreal. The story shows why Bruce Wayne’s morality makes him the ideal Batman. He is uniquely suited to be the kind of hero that Gotham needs, which is made plain by juxtaposing him with the murderous Azreal. 14 Justice League of America: Tower of Babel by Mark Waid &amp; Howard Porter Two stories solidified the notion that Batman can kick anyone's ass. The first was Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, where Batman outwits and outduels Superman, the other is Mark Waid's excellent JLA story, Tower of Babel. Batman, we discover, has a plan for everything. That includes what to do if any of his allies in the Justice League go rogue. He's prepared to take down any of his friends when necessary. And when an enemy unlocks those secret plans and uses them against the JLA, we get to see Batman's obsessive planning come to fruition. 13 Batman: Black &amp; White by Various Artists &amp; Writers Here's a novel concept: Take the best writers and artists in comics, give them only a handful of pages to work with, and ask them to create complete and compelling stories about the Dark Knight. The result is the fascinating, varied, and sometimes hilarious Batman: Black &amp; White. If Batman's legend were a diamond, this book would show you every facet. Some of the stories in B&amp;W are larks, some are very serious. Each shows a slightly different side of the Batman. My personal favorite is the Neil Gaiman/Simon Bisley romp &quot;A Black &amp; White World&quot; which imagines Joker and Batman as actors playing out parts within the pages of a comic book. 12 Batman and Son by Grant Morrison &amp; Andy Kubert Grant Morrison’s Batman epic has come to a close, and we feel strongly that the material collected in Batman and Son best encapsulates his best and most lasting addition to the Batman mythos: Damian Wayne. He is the lovechild of Bruce Wayne and Talia Al Ghul, genetically engineered to be perfect and trained by the League of Assassins to one day replace his father. He treats Alfred like an indentured servant, kills crooks instead of arresting them, and wants to kill Tim Drake to take his place as Robin. Who knew that one of Batman’s greatest challenges would be attempting to raise a spoiled, violent child he didn’t even know existed? It would be a silly PG-rated movie if it weren’t so darkly told by Grant Morrison. Damian makes an excellent source of antagonism throughout the story, but in dealing with his son’s extreme behavior, Batman shows a personal side to him rarely glimpsed while also reinforcing Batman’s code of ethics. 11 Batman: Gotham By Gaslight by Brian Augustyn &amp; Mike Mignola Set in the Victorian era, the origin of Batman hasn't changed much in Gotham By Gaslight. Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered, he travelled abroad to train so that he could return to Gotham as its protector. Only catch is that while Bruce was in London, a madman was on the loose cutting up prostitutes. And when Bruce returns home to Gotham, the murders follow him. If you're going to suspect someone of slashing up ladies with a scalpel, why not the eccentric son of a doctor? After all, can Bruce Wayne explain his nocturnal habits? Gotham By Gaslight is a tightly woven mystery that never tries to do too much. Sometimes Elseworlds tales throw in every bit of Batman lore and the Cray computers to boot. Wisely, Augustyn sticks to what makes sense for the story and pulls off one of the better tales in Batman's long history. Continues The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels Page 3 Of 3 Continued from Page 2 10 Batman: Hush by Jeph Loeb &amp; Jim Lee Jeph Loeb has mastered the lengthy storyline that cycles through Batman's Rogues Gallery. Usually these are stories from Batman's past, but Hush is a modern tale that uses some of the same clever gimmicks as The Long Halloween. We're left to wonder at the identity of a new mastermind villain named Hush who's playing all of Batman's old enemies in an effort to ruin the Dark Knight's life. It's a mystery with a controversial resolution, but if the journey is what matters, well, then Hush belongs on the list of the 25 must-read Batman books. While we’re not a big fan of how Hush resolves itself, the individual pieces are brilliant. This is one of the few Batman stories to give some notable page space to explore the Batman/Catwoman relationship with some depth, which makes it noteworthy by itself. The real star, though, is Jim Lee's art, which just might be his best work in his time at DC Comics. 9 Batman: The Black Mirror by Scott Snyder, Jock &amp; Francesco Francavilla One of the more recently published stories on this list, The Black Mirror tells two distinct stories drawn by two different artists -- both masters in their own right -- and then marries them together in the end with an unexpected (and polarizing) twist. Most notable -- and potentially blasphemous -- is that this story stars Dick Grayson under the cowl instead of Bruce Wayne, who at the time was believed dead. Commissioner Gordon isn’t happy with it, but over the course of the story they form a bond not unlike the one with Bruce in Batman: Year One. But the true obstacle for this new Batman comes in the form of James Gordon Jr., the Commissioner’s psychotic murderer of a son and modern day classic villain. Thanks to him, the tale is steeped in horror and full of deftly executed twists, not to mention the mystery he is responsible for is one that even Bruce would have had trouble with. 8 Batman: Year 100 by Paul Pope The name says it all. This is Batman, set a hundred years after the original's Gotham debut. Sadly, Gotham City is no better than it was a century ago. The police are still ravaged by corruption and too much of the city is gripped by poverty. But there is hope. There is a Batman. At least, that's the myth. No, this isn't Bruce Wayne at 120 years old. This is a new man in the suit, with a new Robin. But as we learn, the cape and cowl have become part of a legacy. A legacy most of Gotham has forgotten. Well, they're about to get a reminder. Year 100 is different. Not just because it's set in the future. This is the rare Batman story that doesn't try to hang tight to the Bruce Wayne version of Batman. It's fresh and new and exciting. And yet, it has some very clear connections to Batman: Year One, keeping this wild fantasy of a futuristic Dark Knight tethered to the core mythology. 7 Batman: Dark Victory by Jeph Loeb &amp; Tim Sale Sequel to the wildly successful Long Halloween, Dark Victory offers another year-long look into Batman's early career. It is a continuation of Long Halloween, picking up on some loose threads from the original and doesn't stand quite as well on its own. The biggest addition is Robin. The Boy Wonder's origin is retold in more depth than ever before. Why would Batman want a partner? No, the real question is: Why would anyone want to partner with Batman? What stands strongest in Dark Victory is the smart and effective re-imagining of the first Robin's origin. We tend to accept that Dick Grayson became Robin because he was adopted by Batman. That's pretty shallow reasoning. Dark Victory gives us a little more substance. 6 Batman: Red Rain by Doug Moench &amp; Kelley Jones A scourge of the undead has hit Gotham City, turning its lowliest citizens into vampire warriors. The only thing keeping the vamps from turning Gotham into a buffet is Batman. One problem -- he's been infected too. Batman has often been called a creature of the night. In Red Rain, that's literal. Batman's challenge is two-fold: Stop the vamps from taking over the city and resist the urge to break his &quot;one rule&quot; and feed on another human being. Long before True Blood, the vampire craze hit comics thanks to the almost abstract art of Kelley Jones and the heavy inks of Malcolm Jones III. Batman's ears never stood so tall before. In another artist's hands, Red Rain might read like a farce. But this is an example of the perfect marriage between story and art. 5 Batman: Son of the Demon by Mike W. Barr &amp; Jerry Bingham When Batman and his nemesis Ra's al Ghul find themselves chasing the same assassin, the two form an unexpected partnership. One that reunites Batman with Talia al Ghul, one of his stronger love interests. Is Batman ready to have a father-in-law like Ra's al Ghul? To become a father himself? The answer may surprise you. People love the Joker and claim he is the perfect foil for the Batman. However, Ra's al Ghul can be the best Batman villain if the proper writer gets a hold of him. That's what you get with Son of the Demon, the perfect Ra's al Ghul tale. It's a brilliant, perfectly paced story that also happens to be the origin for the newest (and most interesting) Robin. For years, this book was impossible to find, but thanks to the introduction of Batman's son, Damian Wayne, Son of the Demon has been reprinted and is now readily available. 4 Batman: The Long Halloween by Jeph Loeb &amp; Tim Sale Someone in Gotham's decided to make a killing during the holidays. Each issue tackles another holiday as the year winds round. This new holiday killer has the mob, the cops, Arkham's crazies and the Batman all on edge. The Long Halloween is both a great mystery, among the best told in Batman's long history, and a new look at the Dark Knight's early career, when the status quo of Gotham City was changing. The Long Halloween has all the ingredients of a classic Batman story: A mysterious killer, appearances by notable villains, striking visuals, and an imperfect ending to the case. Special credit to Loeb for making one of the dumbest characters ever created, Calendar Man, appear interesting and necessary. 3 Batman: The Killing Joke by Alan Moore &amp; Brian Bolland The Joker. Batman's greatest foe. His goal is chaos, but the beauty of his madness is the incredible amount of thought he puts into each caper. In the Killing Joke, the Clown Prince of Crime decides he wants to prove that, given the right push, anyone would fall into madness. To go about this, he torments down-to-earth Jim Gordon. All the while, we're given glimpses into the Joker's origin and see what pushed him over the edge. The Killing Joke isn't just a brilliant origin story for comics' most famed villain, it also clearly defines what separates the good guys from the crazy guys. When push comes to shove, the sane ones shove back; the crazies allow themselves to go over the edge. 2 Batman: Year One by Frank Miller &amp; David Mazzucchelli Who would dress up like a bat and prance around the city fighting crime? We all know that answer. Who would stand by his side? That's the story we learn in Year One. Batman and Gordon arrive in Gotham around the same time, both carrying a lot of baggage. Though they spend the year making their fair share of mistakes, they form an uneasy partnership, one that will last throughout their careers. Whenever a new Batman movie is announced, the first question is always: &quot;Who's the villain?&quot; And yet, the best Batman story of all time remains the one that features no marquee villains. At best, you get a cameo from Selina Kyle. Otherwise, this is a story about two men trying to do right in a city where everything has gone wrong. Perhaps that's what makes it so strong. There's no reliance on campy villains or a threat that would wipe out all of Gotham. This is street crime and corruption. This is the impossible battle, the one Batman and Jim Gordon can never win. 1 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller This is the one where Batman kicks Superman's ass. Set a decade after Batman's retirement, The Dark Knight Returns offers a grim vision of the future of Gotham City. Times are bleak and Gotham is in need of a hero. And Bruce Wayne? Well, he's been fighting his obsession for a decade. He simply can't hold out any longer. He puts the suit back on to face off against his oldest foe and his oldest friend. The Dark Knight Returns is a masterpiece of comic-book storytelling. The pages are packed, sometimes with dozens of panels. Overcrowded, even. And yet, Miller creates a distinct pacing through each page and builds to perhaps the most optimistic ending in any Batman story. Yeah, Frank Miller ends with a touch of optimism. For being just as entertaining the first time we read it as the last, creating the definitive dark and moody characterization of the Caped Crusader that is still channeled to this day, and for answering the age old question of &quot;Who would win, Batman or Superman?&quot;, The Dark Knight Returns is the greatest Batman graphic novel of all time.

You’ve got the developers behind Ubuntu working on snaps, App Image (aka the closest thing to .exe files on Linux), Deis, ZeroInstall and of course, the new thing everyone is talking about: Flatpak. For too long the open source community, and Linux as a whole has needed a single way to deliver software to many different Linux distributions. In 2017, there are many different software projects competing for the spotlight. Flatpak is no different. It’s a tool developed by the Free Desktop Project that promises to make it super easy to deliver any type of software, seamlessly and easily to any type of Linux distribution on the market. SPOILER ALERT: Scroll down and watch the video tutorial at the end of this article. In this article, we’ll go over how to get this exciting new technology working on your favorite Linux distribution. Installing FlatPak Flatpak developers have worked hard with Linux distribution maintainers to make it so that getting everything running is easy. Open a terminal window, find the section with the operating system you use, and enter the command(s) to get it installed! Arch Linux sudo pacman -S flatpak Fedora sudo dnf install flatpak OpenSUSE sudo zypper install flatpak Mageia sudo urpmi flatpak or (if using DNF) sudo dnf install flatpak Ubuntu Ubuntu 16.04 LTS sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/flatpak sudo apt update sudo apt install flatpak Ubuntu 17.04+ sudo apt install flatpak Debian Testing/Unstable sudo apt-get install flatpak Gentoo First, gain a root shell: sudo -s or su Next, create a new configuration file: nano -w /etc/portage/repos.conf/flatpak-overlay.conf Paste the following code inside the file: [flatpak-overlay] priority = 50 location = /usr/local/portage/flatpak-overlay sync-type = git sync-uri = git://github.com/fosero/flatpak-overlay.git auto-sync = Yes Save the configuration file with the Ctrl + O keyboard combination. Lastly, run a sync to install Flatpak. emerge --sync Using Flatpak Flatpak is very decentralized technology. Unlike other “universal app” solutions like snaps, there’s no single software store. Instead, there are many. This program allows users to make their own containers, and upload them to the official servers, but it is also possible for users to host their own and ignore the official way entirely. Are you a developer? Check out the official information to learn how to make a Flatpak. Installing a Flatpak from a repository To install a Flatpak app to your Linux computer, open a terminal. Next, enter this command to gain root access: sudo -s In this example, we’ll be installing Spotify via the command line. Start off by telling the Flatpak service to get the remote app. flatpak install --from https://s3.amazonaws.com/alexlarsson/spotify-repo/spotify.flatpakref Then, install Spotify with the run command. flatpak run com.spotify.Client When the process is complete, check your application menu. A Spotify icon will appear. Installing a Flatpak from a file Luckily, the command line is not the only way to install a Flatpak app. It is also possible to download a .flatpakref file, and install it without entering a single command. First, make sure that gnome-software is installed on the system (though it most likely already is). Next, download a .flatpakref file via the app page. In this example, we’ll be using Skype. When the file is downloaded to your PC, open up the file manager and go to the location of the downloaded app. Right click on it, and select “Open With Software Install”. This will launch the Gnome Software store, and bring up a page that shows detailed information of the app that will be installed. Click the install button, enter your password and wait. A notification will pop up when the program is finished. That’s it! Check the application menu for the newly installed program. Updating Flatpaks Updating, like installing is possible in two ways. The first way is with the terminal. Start off by listing all installed Flatpaks on the system with the list command. flatpak list Next, select a Flatpak app from the list, and add it to the end of: flatpak update Doing this will update the individual app. Alternatively, just type flatpak update to update all apps on the system. Don’t want to use the terminal? Just use Gnome Software as normal. When there’s a Flatpak update, it’ll tell you! Install it like normal, along with regular software updates. Uninstalling Flatpaks Uninstall an app by first using the list command to find the name of the app to uninstall. Next, copy the name, and type: sudo flatpak uninstall appnamehere Alternatively, open Gnome Software, search for the app and click “uninstall”. Conclusion Software distribution has always been one of the weakest points of Linux: developers have no desire to package their program in 100 different formats. Additionally, users want a better way to install software rather than relying on the terminal. Flatpack is another attempt to fix this. It accomplishes this massive task by taking programs and virtualizing them inside of containers, allowing them to run on anything at any time. Development for this software is picking up pace, with Flatpaks helping deliver popular software like: Spotify, Blender, Mozilla Firefox and even Microsoft Skype. Support for this tool is massive, and adoption is only getting better. Flatpaks have a lot of potential, but they’re overshadowed by other players in the “universal Linux installer” game. As a result, they’re only known by Linux geeks. It is my hope that this tutorial will shine some much needed light on Flatpak, so that all types of Linux users can start using them!

The series starred Jeremy Brett as Holmes and David Burke (in the Adventures series) and later Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson. The programme adapted 41 of the original stories, with 36 running for 50 minutes (in a one-hour timeslot), and five being feature-length specials.

The other shows that produced mini-episodes for the special were Van der Valk, Taggart, and Inspector Wexford. Unadapted storiesEdit Though the Granada series is one of the most comprehensive screen adaptations of the Holmes canon,[b] it nevertheless left nineteen stories unadapted after Sherlock Holmes actor Jeremy Brett's sudden death in 1995. These stories comprise two of the novels and seventeen of the short stories. These are: A Study in Scarlet &quot;A Case of Identity&quot; &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Yellow Face&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Gloria Scott&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Reigate Squire&quot; &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Three Students&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter&quot; The Valley of Fear &quot;His Last Bow&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot; (Although the main theme of this story is present in &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot;) &quot;The Adventure of the Lion's Mane&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger&quot; (Although elements of this story are present in &quot;The Eligible Bachelor&quot;) &quot;The Adventure of the Retired Colourman&quot; NotesEdit ^ a b c d e Feature-length special. ^ See the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series (1921–1923), for which 47 of the stories were adapted.

The extension is developed and maintained by Raymond Hill (Gorhill), the developer of uBlock Origin, a popular content blocker that is also available for various browsers including Firefox. Why two extensions and not just one? While both extensions can be used for the same purpose -- blocking content -- they are different when it comes to scope. Without going into too much detail: uMatrix is like the advanced brother of uBlock Origin. It gives you more control, and comes with privacy enhancements on top of that. uMatrix for Firefox umatrix firefox guideumatrix firefox guide ADVERTISEMENT You can install uMatrix in any recent version of the Firefox web browser from Mozilla AMO. Simply visit the website, and click on the &quot;add to Firefox&quot; button to do so. I suggest you disable or remove any content blocker that is installed in the browser before you do so (e.g. NoScript, uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus) to avoid issues. The extension adds an icon to Firefox's main toolbar that you use to control what sites may load. Before you do, you may want to visit the options of the extension to make changes to the initial configuration. The easiest way to get there is to click on the extension icon after installation and there on the title bar that displays &quot;go to dashboard&quot; on hover. Preferences The preferences are divided into tabs; the very first, Settings, list several interesting options. ADVERTISEMENT umatrix settings firefoxumatrix settings firefox Here is a list of preferences that you may find useful. I suggest you go through them all though as you may find some useful that are not mentioned here. Settings &gt; Convenience -- Show the number of distinct requests on the icon. Settings &gt; Convenience -- Collapse placeholder of blocked elements. (If an element is blocked, placeholder is collapsed. May result in a cleaner site, may cause display issues on some sites. Settings &gt; PrivacyÂ -- Delete blocked cookies. uMatrix does not prevent sites from setting (blacklisted) cookies, but it blocks cookies from leaving your local system. Settings &gt; PrivacyÂ -- Delete local storage content set by blocked hostnames. (removes data stored by blocked hostnames on the local system). Settings &gt; Privacy -- Spoof HTTP referrer string of third-party requests. The extension will spoof the HTTP referrer information if the domain name of the HTTP referrer is third-party to the domain name of net request. Settings &gt; Privacy -- Strict HTTPS: forbid mixed content -- Prevents the loading of non-secure content on HTTPS sites. Settings &gt; Privacy -- Block all hyperlink auditing attempts. Prevents that sites may add pings to links to inform &quot;any party&quot;. You may also check the list of hosts lists the extension uses by default, and may add new lists to it. It loads six lists by default to block malware, ads and tracking servers automatically. ADVERTISEMENT Switch to the Assets tab to take a look. You may use the import option to add hosts files or disable some of the available resources. Once you are done with that, you need to decide how to run uMatrix. You have two main options to do so: block all or allow all. The interface umatrix interfaceumatrix interface The interface may look intimidating on first glance. It lists all first party and third-party connections a web page makes, and data types such as cookies, CSS or script, that are loaded or blocked. Colors are used to indicate loaded and blocked content, with green highlighting content that is loaded and red content that is blocked. You may click on a header, e.g. cookie, to set up uMatrix to allow or disallow this type of data globally (with exceptions that you define). Green indicates that a content type is allowed, red that it is disallowed. Tip: you set something to allowed (green) if you click in the upper half of a box, and to disallowed (red) if you click in the lower half. The difference between dark and light green, and dark and light red is the following one: Darker colors mean that there is a whitelist or blacklist entry assigned to the cell, lighter colors that the status is inherited. Another option that you have is to allow or disallow for specific hostnames. You may block or allow all for a hostname, or use the granular controls to allow or disallow certain types of data, for instance frames. Block all block allblock all If you set uMatrix to block all, all is blocked from being loaded except for the elements that you whitelist. To enable the block all mode, blacklist (set to red) the &quot;all&quot; and &quot;frame&quot; cells of the table. You may want to allow the &quot;css&quot; and &quot;img&quot; cells so that styles and images do get loaded when you connect to sites. Click on the padlock icon to save the modified configuration. This mode blocks all but CSS and images. It improves privacy and security, and is beneficial to the bandwidth on top of that. A downside to this is that you will run into sites that don't render properly or at all so that you may need to allow certain things on particular sites to access them. Allow All allow allallow all Allow all allows any connection and type to be loaded with the exception of hostnames that are blacklisted. This is better for compatibility purposes, but problematic from a privacy and security point of view. To configure it, set the &quot;all&quot; cell to green, and make sure any other cell is set to green as well. Don't forget to click on the padlock icon to save the new configuration. The core advantage of allow all is that you won't run into nearly as many rendering issues as with block all, but the effect on privacy and security is diminished. Closing Words How you configure uMatrix depends entirely on you. If you want maximum privacy and security, you should go with the block all approach and whitelist only hostnames that you trust. You can still allow certain things temporarily using uMatrix, or load a site in private browsing mode instead. uMatrix resources and further reading uMatrix GitHub page uMatrix Wiki (detailed information on all aspects of the extension, and more) ADVERTISEMENT Summary A uMatrix guide for FirefoxA uMatrix guide for Firefox Article Name A uMatrix guide for Firefox Description The uMatrix guide for Firefox helps you get started with the Firefox extension uMatrix, a sophisticated connection and ontent blocker for the browser.

For convenience, when pages break, just allow all parties temporarily. uMatrix cannot block scripts independently from host names, you can use uBlock Origin for that. Millenicide said on December 4, 2017 at 5:47 pm Reply “uMatrix cannot block scripts independently from host names, you can use uBlock Origin for that.” Can you please explain this in more detail. :) yikes said on November 28, 2017 at 8:49 am Reply Can anyone explain the little triangles in the top left corner of some of the squares? Martin Brinkmann said on November 28, 2017 at 9:05 am Reply Green triangle on light red cell: permanently whitelisted cell that is temporarily graylisted (anything from hostname will be blocked, but the main frame). Green triangle on dark red cell: permanently whitelisted cell that is blacklisted temporarily. Mike said on November 28, 2017 at 9:21 am Reply I’ve always wondered this but if you install uMatrix, is uBlock Origin not necessary anymore? Can uMatrix do everything that uBlock does but better? Cloudman said on November 28, 2017 at 1:51 pm Reply uMatrix doesn’t have esthetic filters. BM said on November 28, 2017 at 3:30 pm Reply Agree. The eyedropper tool (element picker) is a big reason we have both installed. There are other reasons, I have since forgotten, but I think one reason had to do with lists unique to uB Origin not available in uMatrix. (Edit: I see Donkeyfumbler below mentions this). uMatrix is a PITA if one uses a virtual/sandbox environment, as the settings cannot be easily saved. However, the extra level of protection is still worth it, IMHO. Django said on November 29, 2017 at 3:10 pm Reply uBO is a second line of defence. uMatrix replaces advantageously the dynamic filtering part of uBO, but the static filtering part remains. If you allow YouTube embedded videos on Ghacks through dynamic filtering, static filtering will ensure that YouTube tracking scripts and ads will remain blocked. uBO has dynamic filtering but it’s limited and I can find no satisfying way to use it, so ultimately I always have to install uMatrix and defer ALL dynamic filtering to it. The downside is that uBO can’t inject neutered scripts any more, those help in keeping site functionality intact when they are coded poorly enough to break without, say, Google Analytics. I wish uBO and uMatrix were more readily compatible and made to work with each other. I don’t see a point in using uMatrix without an adblocker, and uBO’s dynamic filtering doesn’t cut it for me. IMO uMatrix UI is also infinitely more appropriate when what the user wants is a clear view of what’s going on. Donkeyfumbler said on November 28, 2017 at 9:33 am Reply I’m really not entirely sure why there are two add-ins by the same developer that seem to do fairly much exactly the same thing. From what I can see UBlock, once you turn on advanced mode, does exactly the same kind of element filtering in exactly the same way, down to the light and dark colours. However it also has fairly extensive ad-blocking filter black lists that Umatrix doesn’t. From what I can tell then, the question is the other way round – why would I use umatrix when ublock does the same and more? Also, why does the dev not just combine the two into one add-in? Sophie said on November 28, 2017 at 10:15 am Reply I found when I tried Umatrix, (being already a UBO user, with extensive use of UBO), that Umatrix seemed almost overkill. I would be happy with the learning curve, as I like to understand as much as possible, but I found that it needed too much management and broke too many things. To be honest, everything went fairly haywire. Granted that all this would settle down once you managed it properly, so this is in no way the fault of Umatrix, I simply reached the conclusion that UBO was more than sufficient. Big thanks to the developer though, pretty much nothing to touch his extensions. BM said on November 28, 2017 at 3:59 pm Reply Depends on your use case. If you do a lot of research online (i.e. need to visit multiple sites over time vs visit a limited number of sites), you get to have a very good feel for which hostnames to allow, and which to remain blocked. Where things go “haywire” are websites that require some element (usually a script) that is only available after authorizing a hard blocked (dark red) hostname’s script (i.e. a script that is flagged within one of the lists). That required one will not be present until the prerequisite is authorized. Figuring this out is problematic, to say the least. If the site is important enough, sometimes I turn off uMatrix, and sometimes even uB Origin too. Sometimes that is not even enough. If site is “crucial” and reached this point, then it is on to (rarely used) Edge. Otherwise, I abandon that site. We use two additional Chrome extensions to help: uB Origin Extra and uB Origin Protection. The latter helps greatly with websites that block adblockers, usually with another page or an overlay that obscures content. Overall, having more difficulties with sites that block VPN access than with using Gorhill’s tools. BM said on December 10, 2017 at 12:11 am Reply Just noticed that the extension called uBlock Origin Protection is now called Nano Defender. FYI Silver said on November 28, 2017 at 11:28 am Reply “From what I can tell then, the question is the other way round – why would I use umatrix when ublock does the same and more?” It’s the opposite. Why would I use ublock when umatrix does the same and more. That being said, like Sophie, umatrix is overkill. It’s very powerful but as a result, it’s very tedious for very little more protection. Therefore for most users, it’s better to just stick with ublock in advanced mode. However, for the power users who like minute control over everything as well as knowing exactly how many images, scripts, and more are loaded from which domain, umatrix is perfect for that. But for me? Not my cup of tea. Donkeyfumbler said on November 28, 2017 at 11:48 am Reply As I said Ublock has the filtering lists that Umatrix lacks, but the script and content blocking is fairly much the same on either product. Unless you really need those extra privacy options (and really don’t like cookies), why then choose umatrix over ublock? Lots of people saying it’s ‘more powerful’ but failing to show how that’s actually the case. Silver said on November 29, 2017 at 12:08 am Reply @ Donkeyfumbler One thing is uMatrix shows exactly what type of resource and how many of these resources are being loaded from which domain. Basically if a 3rd party frame is loaded, uMatrix shows the domain of that 3rd party frame. uBlock does not do that or makes it very hard to find out. In other words, uBlock simply tells you nothing about what resources are being loaded unless you decided to block them which uBlock will show something like “18 or 81%” resources blocked from loading. uMatrix tells you exactly how many resources were blocked, where it’s coming from (the domain), and what type is the resource. All these information is given whether you blocked the resources or not. That gives you a lot more info in helping you modify your lists and filter for certain sites. uMatrix then allows you fine control over those resources from different domains. For example, what if I don’t want to block all 3rd party scripts? Only certain ones? Basically like I said, uMatrix gives you granular control. And that’s very likely the very reason why the author did not combine the two. If you give uBlock that much granular control, it’s too much for most users. Instead, the author separate this fine granular control into uMatrix and the “coarse” control in uBlock. For most users, uBlock is good enough. For the users that are anal about over every resource type and where it’s coming from, they have uMatrix. People saying uMatrix is more powerful does not take anything away from uBlock so I honestly don’t know why you are so worried over it. Who cares if a Ferrari is more powerful than a minivan if all I want to do is have enough space to carry my groceries. Something being more powerful does not mean it’s the best at everything. dd said on November 28, 2017 at 10:31 am Reply use a browser with lots of blocker stuff for regular use.. use another browser with less when it breaks. use edge for no filter when you can’t be bothered to figure out what gets what blocked Hans said on November 28, 2017 at 10:39 am Reply What ist the effect of the the rule â€ž* * frame blockâ€œ?

I canâ€™t see the difference. gorhill said on November 28, 2017 at 1:18 pm Reply * * frame block = “block all frames from everywhere” (starting from the scope where the rule exists). This will cause the header “frame” cell to be blacklisted (dark red). The higher precedence “frame” cells will inherit this block rule (pale red) by virtue of uMatrix rule-propagation logic.

Thorky said on November 28, 2017 at 10:42 am Reply The first thing you should do after installing uMatrix is: – click the small grey cogwheel in the upper left of uMatrix window – open My Rules – click Edit-Button below Temporary Rules on the right side of the page – add the term&gt; * * script block &lt;to the list – click Save – click Commit From now on, Scripts are blocked by standard like in NoScript! :) Tom Hawack said on November 28, 2017 at 11:00 am Reply &gt; “From now on, Scripts are blocked by standard like in NoScript! :)” And the per-site script authorizations’ madness as well! The number of sites which rely on scripts is a majority. Here with uBO I do block all scripts … from 3rd-party sites (as well as calling those very sites) but indeed that doesn’t protect from a given site’s own scripts : for those I rely on uBO’s filters. Sure, this policy is applicable with uMatrix I guess. But a too high granular protection can be terribly time consuming. Django said on November 29, 2017 at 3:26 pm Reply You can allow all first party scripts with uMatrix (NoScript too) by default if you want. With per-site permissions you can save your non-global rules without worry, which means you only have to setup rules once, not twice. (Like you do with a Windows per-application firewall) Many sites don’t need JavaScript, so if you allow CSS, images and frames to first party sites by default, you won’t need to tweak all sites even on first time visit. Maybe 50% ? If on top of that you also allow CSS and images globally for all sites except those blocked by filter lists, first time visits where you need to add permissions become rather infrequent. And with uMatrix (and NoScript), you don’t end up allowing more than you thought, unlike uBO. (I love uBO but I just have to defend uMatrix and NoScript because I don’t think it’s remotely true that uBO can replace either of them, its role is to run alongside one of them if security and privacy are the user’s priorities.) Kubrick said on January 22, 2018 at 9:34 pm Reply @thorky. thats pointless. you may as well just turn off javascript in the browser itself. Tom Hawack said on November 28, 2017 at 10:47 am Reply uMatrix’s page on AMO is explicit : “*For advanced users.*”. What defines an “advanced user”? What does it mean to be, to consider myself or someone as advanced in terms of computing knowledge? I don’t have the answer. A rather relative definition perhaps. Some users stick on ‘Adblock (Plus)’ because they consider that ‘uBlock Origin’ (uBO) required advanced skills. That’s my position regarding uMatrix and some uMatrix users on the other hand will consider the extension as perfectly accessible… hard to tell. What is sure is that uBO is not presented as “For advanced users” and is obviously less complex to use than uMatrix. Complex, not complicated. Some may also as myself lack confidence in their true abilities and/or express a sort of “intellectual laziness” (yawn and “wow, too tiring”). As far as I’m concerned I’ll point out this : 1- Yes, I believe I could make it to uMatrix should I make the effort. Yes, I’d make the effort if uBO didn’t exist because traditional ad blockers are far too far from what I consider as essential to give a chance to privacy and security nowadays when running a browser. 2- I use uBO intensively, I have a wide array of filters and rules, mine included. I’d have to move those to uMatrix, in what conditions, what is movable and what is not…. Maybe I should have started with uMatrix rather than uBO, maybe did I lack self-confidence or maybe was I tempted by a good “less effort”/”efficiency” ratio. Magnana maybe. (is that how you spell ‘tomorrow in Spanish?!). I often doubt that laziness is considered as a capital sin and sometimes I vaguely perceive why is could definitely be one :) Sophie said on November 28, 2017 at 11:44 am Reply @Tom – agreed too…..I have made use of a lot of filtering on uBO, my own as well as what’s on offer, and also export these to a NAS drive which my whole network picks up and Syncs with. To migrate those over to uMatrix, be uncertain how they will fit – what will work, what won’t , what might break….and then at the end of it, not even be sure if I have achieved much, these are the reasons I stick with uBO. If I had gone with iMatrix to begin with, I would be at that place of “maturity” with it, but as I see it, it just seems like life is too short, and the ability for it to break things perhaps just a little too great. Not its’ fault of course….only mine for not trying hard enough. BM said on November 28, 2017 at 4:14 pm Reply Making a mountain out of a mole hill. uMatrix is easy for anyone with technical skills. For most use cases, uMatrix need only be set the first time a site is encountered, and the settings saved. Unless the website changes, this should suffice for all future encounters. One can either do this, or choose to invest their time with a wide array of filters and rules in uB O. I don’t bother with that, as I like the deny first approach of uM and the easy selectivity right at the browser. Agree that even with uB Origin, users needs some level of technical understanding to deal with any configuration settings outside of the default. Indeed, it is relative, as is the “efficiency ratio”. Tom Hawack said on November 28, 2017 at 4:33 pm Reply “uMatrix is easy for anyone with technical skills.” : that’s the montain! “Agree that even with uB Origin, users needs some level of technical understanding to deal with any configuration settings outside of the default.” : that’s the moll hill! You can choose (not you, BM, I’m talkin’ to ’em fellas lazier than I) flat grounds but where’s the pleasure with no effort?! Forget the pleasure, it’s privacy and security which are concerned! Bonus? Besides privacy and security, no ads and faster page rendering : now what would we say about that? I say : grrr, I should at least give uMatrix a try. Don’t whip me, that don’t help; rather share your experience with uMatrix, as BM does, with a smile and an Everest of encouragements : we need them :) Richard Allen said on November 28, 2017 at 5:12 pm Reply MaÃ±ana ;) Totally agree. I would probably have to say that performance, ease of use, security and privacy are my ‘goals’ when online, and probably in the order that they are listed. I like uMatrix but once I moved from FF ESR, I started to pare down my add-ons in preparation for 57+ and uMatrix ended up in my disabled list. In it’s place I’ve been using “No-Script Suite Lite (revived)”, it’s lite on resources, takes like two seconds to enable js, most often permanently, and I’m basically just using it as a javascript whitelist, mostly so that when visiting a new site (intentionally or not) js will be disabled, there are also a handful (surprisingly large handful) of sites I regularly visit that I’ve left js disabled because they work and look fine for my purposes. Even blocking js on new, unknown websites might be a little on the overkill side of things for some people since I use uBlock Origin to globally block 3rd party iframes and I use dozens of my own personal rules and filters. For example, some websites I have javascript enabled in No-Script Suite Lite but then have 3rd party js blocked with uBO or maybe just a specific individual script is blocked preventing auto playing video. On websites that I know are guilty of having inadvertently (maybe) distributed malware in the past, the odds of my enabling All javascript on those sites is Very slim. With the capability available in uBO it’s hard for me to feel like I’m missing out by not using uMatrix. or even NoScript Security Suite, which should not be confused with No-Script Suite Lite (revived), the latter is what I’m using. All that said, I feel very fortunate to have Mr. Hill developing both uBO and uMatrix!! I’m hoping somehow someway that the ad ecosystem gets cleaned up or at the very least doesn’t get worse than it is now so that I don’t feel like I need to resort to using something like uMatrix. I am much too lazy to have to do that!! Tom Hawack said on November 28, 2017 at 5:26 pm Reply Hello Richard! I read you attentively as always. You mention the “No-Script Suite Lite (revived)” Firefox extension which “allows JavaScript (inline &amp; external) to be executed only by trusted websites of your choice.” (as mentioned on AMO). But this feature is included in uBO with the ‘1st-party scripts’ setting. What is the advantage of adding an extension which performs the same thing as uBO? Richard Allen said on November 28, 2017 at 5:43 pm Reply Basically, I do Not want to Globally block w/uBO: inline,1st party or 3rd party javascript and maybe most importantly I do Not want to visit a new website, no matter how I got there, with Any javascript enabled. Ease of use is extremely important, for me. Richard Allen said on November 28, 2017 at 6:03 pm Reply I’m going to repeat myself because I edited my post in the last minute and it will probably be stuck in the Twilight Zone for a while. I know better and I still do it too often, a last minute edit. ;) Basically, I do Not want to Globally block w/uBO: inline, 1st party or 3rd party javascript and maybe most importantly I do Not want to visit a new website, no matter how I got there, with Any javascript enabled. Ease of use is extremely important, for me. You’re right, the exact same thing can be done with uBO. It just feels easier to me to let No-Script Suite Lite take care of globally blocking js instead of in the long run adding a hundred or two more rules in uBO. Richard Allen said on November 28, 2017 at 6:21 pm Reply I forgot to mention my concern about at what point does the number of personal rules and filters that I’m using start to impact the performance and memory use of uBO. I’m already using dozens of MY Rules and MY Filters. I don’t know what the impact would be or if there is even any impact at all if I were to add another hundred or two rules. So… I’m just playing it safe a little bit. Var said on November 28, 2017 at 12:50 pm Reply I have used uMatrix to bypass paywalls on certain sites. Doesn’t work on all but on a few its quite effective. But it seems to have a steep learning curve, its not easy to get right away. dw4rf_toss said on November 28, 2017 at 12:57 pm Reply Cool, with a side of “I’ll shoot my eye out”. There’s an older release that runs with “old” Firefox without webextensions (1.1.4), so I’m running the old version. I’ve disabled uMatrix hosts files, as I either opted out of them in uBlock or they are already covered by it. So if I end up hating this, I can just uninstall uMatrix. Again: got uBlock and uMatrix running in tandem, all seems well enough. Side note: I’m letting uBlock origin handle the “list” blocking and disabled such in uMatrix; I was getting unnecessary page reloads when both have same lists enabled. So far, uMatrix has proven useful, though. It shows exactly what it is blocking, and unblocking things to test is thankfully pretty simple. I was able to allow Disqus chat and some other functions very quickly. Then ya click the lock icon to save permanently once ya get it all just so. Just disable the lists in uMatrix if you want to play with it and not break anything you depend on in uBlock. I guess my bottom line is that uBlock is just too useful to let go (element zapper, anyone?). 12bytes said on November 28, 2017 at 1:41 pm Reply Firefox Configuration Guide for Privacy Freaks and Performance Buffs | 12Bytes.org http://12bytes.org/tech/firefoxgecko-configuration-guide-for-privacy-and-performance-buffs Peter said on November 28, 2017 at 3:03 pm Reply Love it!

MdN said on November 28, 2017 at 3:09 pm Reply I’ve been using uMatrix ever since I found out about it. Once I learned my way around it, it has become a routine, and compared to uBlock sometimes I save a few seconds of loading time on some websites simply because it’s easier to see what there is to filter. For my use it’s perfect as I, 90 percent of the time, tend to visit the same bunch of websites. When I started I installed it on my less-used browser and I would slowly, when I had free time, edit the settings for all my favorite websites. Once I was done, I just exported the settings and applied them to uMatrix in my other browsers. Daguil said on November 28, 2017 at 4:46 pm Reply I use UBo for static filtering (non-advanced-mode) and uMatrix for Dynamic filtering. I am not a developer. But I did spend a full week reading the Wilders Security forum on UBo. While Gorhill removed the page from his wiki on how to use both UBo and Umatrix together :(, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been able to piece together from Wilderâ€™s security forums. NOTE: this assumes youâ€™re going to use UBo and Umatrix together. In UBo: – Settings: o Uncheck â€œI am an advanced userâ€ o Check all the Privacy settings – 3rd Party Filters: o Check the boxes for â€œAuto-updateâ€ and â€œParse Cosmeticâ€ o Myfilters o All the uBlock filters (per Gorhill, these are not optional) o Easylist o Easyprivacy o All the Fanboyâ€™s stuff o Personal: * Chef Kochâ€™s BarBlock @ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHEF-KOCH/BarbBlock-filter-list/master/uBlock.txt * NoCoin Filter List o UNCHECK all of the Malware domains. o UNCHECK all of the multipurpose domains. o Only check the â€œRegionsâ€ that apply to where you live &amp; browse. – My rules: o no-csp-reports: * true o behind-the-scene * 3p noop o behind-the-scene * 3p-frame noop In uMatrix: – Settings: Self explanatory. – Privacy: Check everything. (Except for me, I unchecked â€œSpoof User Agentâ€…this broke a few sites I need to work.) – My rules: o Youâ€™ll tailor these as needed to make your own sites work. Everyone draws a different line between privacy and convenience. I’ve seen others share their lists, but I personally didn’t find it very helpful since we all browse different sites. o Generally, I block all and allow as exceptions only on the websites I need to get working. But I universally allow youtube vids, since they are pretty much everywhere and I didnâ€™t want to bother too much with enabling them on every site. Most would find my approach too difficult/time-consuming, others would say Iâ€™m crazy to allow Youtube everywhere. o If you find yourself allowing “ajax.googleapis.com” on every site and you don’t want to bother with a rule to allow it on each site, then allow it universally like I did. Ditto for “Code.jquery.com”. o After about a week of using this config, you’ll find the pattern of what needs to be enabled for sites to work. Seems like many sites use a 3rd party site for their own CDN &amp; images. i.e. consumerreports.org requires: consumerreportscdn.org and static5.consumerreportscdn.org. You must allow those two scripts/XHR on their site in order to see the tables of product comparisons. o Using the consumerreports.org example: All of the really bad staff that got blacklisted by the filters was NOT required for the site to function. And I recognized the CDN &amp; Static script/XHR right away a allowed them on that site only. So I had this site running almost immediately, and it worked fine while blocking the most intrusive stuff. That’s how it is with many sites (for now.) o If you use the â€œDecentraleyesâ€ (recommended by Gorhill), thereâ€™s a few domains you must allow. See: https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions – Hosts Files: o Check the box to auto-update. o Turn on all hosts files. Youâ€™ll notice that these are all the filters you unchecked over in UBo. I forget the technical reason for this, but the developer-types on the Wilders Security forums seemed fairly certain this was the way to go. Backup your configurations. I invested several weeks mastering this configuration, I canâ€™t even imagine starting from scratch. I also use Pants/Earthlngâ€™s User.js file, to include blocking all cookies/enabling them on a per-site/per-session basis. Between the two Gorhill extensions and the User.js file, Iâ€™m confident that Iâ€™m safe from non-targeted attacks/privacy intrusions. The biggest risk now isâ€¦me. There are sites that just refuse to work with this much stuff blocked. So, I use a tiered approach, with my old Chrome setup as the secondary, Edge as the third option (with UBo in advanced blocking mode), and Internet Explorer as an absolute last resort that requires a full disk-cleanup and a quick shower after using. Big thanks to Gorhill, Pants, Earthlng, Chef Koch, Synzvato, 12bytes, and everyone else (especially the filter/blocklist maintainers) who make the Internet safe to browse. I think of you guys all the time! Seems like a handfull of heroes maintain free privacy tools for us laypeople against billions, billions, and billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of corporate revenues generated by invading our privacy &amp; risking our security from malware. You guys are singular contributors in the history of capitalism. Thank you. Bronckman said on November 28, 2017 at 6:00 pm Reply Thank you, Martin for bringing some light into this matter. Personally I do consider Umatrix’s UI a desaster. It is confusing and not self explanatory. I tried to work with it and ended up being highly frustrated and toxicated after solacing myself with some powerful drops of spirits from my bar. I am not saying this program is bad. I believe it’s a fine piece of work but ruined by its UI. So, dear developer: please have mercy with us ignorant and illiterate computer users and try to change it for the better. I am also greatly convinced it won’t happen. I am ready and willing to take the usual insults and name callings which are happening here much too often. Honestly, I don’t care about it and the person behind it, it’s meaningless. But if someone has something meaningful to say, your are very, very welcome. Clairvaux said on November 29, 2017 at 6:20 am Reply Have a look at the Wiki. It’s extremely helpful. uMatrix has a learning curve, but this was the help formerly missing to clear the first hurdle, which is quite low actually. Once you’ve got the first knack of it, you’re allowed mistakes and you don’t need to understand everything to use it. Provided you learn the basics, it’s like getting to ride a bicycle or to drive a car. It’s only intimidating when you’ve never left base. https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki Gabriel said on November 28, 2017 at 8:07 pm Reply Great article, Martin. The only thing I wish uMatrix had was selective blocking. As in, for example, being able to block specific scripts on a webpage and not all of them. I messaged the developer about this and said he wasn’t going to implement it. Sometimes a webpage has 3 scripts.. 2 needed for it to function and 1 nasty one. What to do in these cases? Tom Hawack said on November 28, 2017 at 8:31 pm Reply Many, most if not all lists include scripts’ filtering, not only ads. This is true with uBO and it is true with uMatrix. This is why lists are so important given that they remain as body guards in case the user opts for the less protective policy (allow all and block selectively). The ultimate is always block all and allow selectively but requires more work, even if with time we get used to it and spot quickly what can/should be allowed. Gabriel said on November 28, 2017 at 8:34 pm Reply Hi Tom. Yes, that’s what I do. I block all and then allow what is needed. But you can’t allow 1 script and block 2 other scripts from the same domain. You block all or allow all. Tom Hawack said on November 28, 2017 at 8:53 pm Reply @Gabriel, I don’t know how it works in uMatrix but with uBO you can enable/disable scripts selectively with the ‘Logger’ feature : just search for ‘Scripts’ from within the Logger and you can then manipulate whatever script (as whatever data type) selectively. Unfortunately I know nothing of uMatrix.

It means you can use the grid of rules you can see for multiple level domains. For example, in the top image on this page, “reddit.com” is highlighted in blue, and to the left of it is in grey. This means that all the rules within the grid (red for block and green for allow), are being applied to any website that ends in ‘reddit.com’. This is useful because you might want rules to only apply to ‘magic.madeupwebsite.com’ and not ‘tasty.madeupwebsite.com’ or in this case to both of them with ‘madeupwebsite.com’. The little asterisk to the right is then for ‘general’ which means ‘apply these rules to every single website’. This is fantastic for fine-tuning. So I can block scripts from blah.com on any website (using the general asterisk and making ‘scripts’ for ‘blah.com’ red), but then only allow it specifically on ‘tasty.madeupwebsite.com’. This means it won’t load the scripts on any site (even madeupwebsite.com, only specifically on tasty.madeupwebsite.com) – a good usecase for this is facebook. You might want to use facebook on facebook.com but block ‘connect.facebook.com’ following you on news sites or asking you to connect your account to it. A bit advanced, but a fantastic tool when you get the hang of it. Clairvaux said on November 29, 2017 at 5:46 am Reply Thank you, Richard Allen and vitamin c. It seems to me that Gorhill tremendously extended the uMatrix Wiki since I remarked here how shorter it was compared to uBlock’s.

We’re getting traction here ! If other talented and devoted people such as him get up to speed on Web Extensions, we would be on to something… Sam said on November 29, 2017 at 4:31 pm Reply Personally I don’t need or actually, WANT, any other privacy or security extension. The more you have, the higher the risk that they mess each other up in unnoticeable yet really counterproductive ways. It was especially true with legacy add-ons but I don’t think WebExtensions are completely immune to that either. So it’s a matter of picking the right ones. I think uBO+NoScript and uBO+uMatrix are pretty nice combinations. With the former, cookies remain to be covered so a third privacy add-on is needed but you get targeted protections against many attacks, some of those enabled even with scripts allowed. It also has script surrogates, which uBO has but can’t use with NoScript. With the latter, cookies are covered and you get an amazing user interface that makes you fully aware of what’s going on, and allows you to unbreak things easily and quickly even when you don’t want to allowing anything more than the bare minimum. Yet, even with just two well known add-ons, in both cases there is some amount of messing one another up going on. Fortunately the collisions do not affect security or privacy or anything important, it’s just illustrating that this risk is real. Some people would add Decentral Eyes to the list, which will limit network requests to common CDN resources needed by many sites, by replacing resources such as (I imagine – I don’t use that add-on) ajax.googleapis.com or cdnjs.cloudflare.com. I don’t know if it collides in any way with NoScript, uBO or uMatrix. Finally, a fully featured NoScript should make uBO+NoScript more secure than uBO+uMatrix. The current WebExtension NoScript is not yet fully featured though (but it’s planned to get there), so at the moment I recommend uBO+uMatrix on Firefox 57+. Sam said on November 29, 2017 at 4:42 pm Reply CORRECTION: *script surrogates, which uBO has but can’t use with uMATRIX. So NoScript having them restores the functionality.

Sam said on November 29, 2017 at 3:51 pm Reply If you use the Tor network then yes, this matters. For privacy and security nothing is better than Tor Browser, which Firefox private browsing mode should end up becoming in the future, once Mozilla and the Tor team are done with Tor Uplift, once the Tor network is ready for the load and as a last step once Tor is shipped with Firefox. If or when you don’t use the Tor network, reducing exposure by limiting network connections is best :) Clairvaux said on November 29, 2017 at 5:34 pm Reply Tor is a thoroughly different step in the privacy arms race. Tor changes your IP. Whereas blockers speed up your browsing, Tor slows it down, considerably in some cases. It’s also also completely non-configurable, and you need to accept a smallish window, at least if yo don’t want to break the inbuilt privacy. There are some (important) sites that are difficult, or impossible to use with Tor. Some sites will start to throw captchas at you all the time. Some might flag you as a potential fraudster if your IP changes at each visit. G00f said on May 14, 2020 at 3:29 am Reply LOL WTF ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT? CHEF-KOCH said on December 3, 2017 at 9:43 pm Reply My own solution to workaround is to give people a database (they can contribute to it) to add their own findings, which lowers the time re-creating the rules each time manually or in case you’re too lazy. The project currently offers, configurations and pre-configured rules for uBlock, uMatrix, NoScript and ScriptSafe. Sadly all of the mentioned tools don’t native support a crowd which can submit/commit their findings, so that’s why I created the project. https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NoScript-Whitelist Amir said on September 30, 2019 at 12:24 pm Reply Hi, dear Martin, I thought to ask you if possible, and if you liked, and needed, please update this article, with any new tips, etc. you might want to add.

                   NS1:content=" 从 Python 切换到 Go 的 9 个理由 2020-05-222020-05-22 15:13:17阅读 3200 作者丨Shiv McIntyre 译者丨刘雅梦 策划丨Tina 切换到一种新的编程语言通常是一件大事，特别是当团队成员对原始语言有丰富经验时。今年年初， Stream 将其主要编程语言从 Python 切换到了 Go。本文将会解释他们决定从 Python 切换到 Go 的一些原因。 使用 Go 的理由 理由 1：性能 Go 非常快。它的性能接近 Java 或 C。Go 的速度比 Python 快 30 倍。 理由 2：语言本身的性能很重要 对于许多应用程序而言，编程语言只是应用程序和数据库之间的粘合剂。语言本身的性能通常并不重要。 Stream 是一家 API 提供商，它为 500 家公司和超过 2 亿的最终用户提供了反馈基础设施。多年来，我们一直在优化 Cassandra、PostgreSQL、Redis 等软件的性能，但是现在我们已经达到了我们所使用编程语言的极限。 Python 是一门伟大的语言，但是对于序列化 / 反序列化、排序和聚合等示例，它的性能非常差。我们经常会遇到性能问题，Cassandra 花费 1ms 的时间来检索数据，而 Python 将其转换成对象则需要 10ms 的时间。 理由 3：开发人员的效率，而无需太多创新 请看下“如何开始学习 Go ”教程中的如下 Go 代码片段。 type openWeatherMap struct{} func (w openWeatherMap) temperature(city string) (float64, error) { resp, err := http.Get(&quot;http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=YOUR_API_KEY&amp;q=&quot; + city) if err != nil { return 0, err } defer resp.Body.Close() var d struct { Main struct { Kelvin float64 `json:&quot;temp&quot;` } `json:&quot;main&quot;` } if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&amp;d); err != nil { return 0, err } log.Printf(&quot;openWeatherMap: %s: %.2f&quot;, city, d.Main.Kelvin) return d.Main.Kelvin, nil} 如果你刚开始学习 Go，阅读这段代码不会有太多惊喜。它演示了赋值、数据结构、指针、格式化和内置的 HTTP 库。 从我首次接触编程开始，我总是喜欢使用 Python 的高级特性。Python 使我们能从正在编写的代码中获得很好的想法。例如，我们可以： 初始化代码时，使用元类（MetaClasses）自己注册类 切换“True”和“False” 将一个函数添加到内置函数列表中 通过魔术方法（Magic Method）重载运算符 这些特性非常有趣，但是，大多数程序员都认为这会增加阅读他人代码的难度。 Go 会迫使我们使用最基本的东西，这使得阅读他人代码变得更容易。 注：当然，“容易”取决于具体的项目。如果只是创建一个基本的 CRUD API，我仍然建议使用 Django&amp; DRF 或 Rails。 理由 4 ：并发和通道 作为一门编程语言，Go 总是尽可能地保持简单。它没有引入太多的新概念，因为它的目标是创建一门易于使用的编程语言。它唯一具有创新性的地方是 Goroutines（go 协程）和 Channels（通道）。Goroutines 是 Go 的轻量级线程解决方案，而 Channels 是与 Goss 交互的首选方式。 Goroutines 非常轻量，仅需要几千字节的额外内存。而且由于 Goroutine 如此轻量，因此可以同时运行数百甚至数千个 Goroutine。 我们可以使用 Channels 在 Goroutines 之间进行通信。Go 运行时处理所有的内部复杂性。基于 Goroutines 和 Channels 的并发方案使应用程序能够轻松使用所有可用的 CPU 内核并处理并发 IoO，而无需进行复杂的开发。与 Python/Java 相比，在 Goroutines 上运行函数只需要很少的固定代码。我们只需要使用关键字“go”调用函数即可： package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;time&quot;)func say(s string) { for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ { time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) fmt.Println(s) }}func main() { go say(&quot;world&quot;) say(&quot;hello&quot;)} https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1 Go 的并发解决方案非常易于使用。与开发人员必须密切关注异步代码处理方式的 Node 相比，这是一个非常有趣的方案。 Go 并发的另一个关注点是竞态检测。它使应用程序能够很容易地知道异步代码中是否存在任何竞态条件。 以下是一些学习 Go 和 Channels 的重要资源： https://gobyexample.com/channels https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2 http://guzalexander.com/2013/12/06/golang-channels-tutorial.html https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10 https://www.goinggo.net/2014/02/the-nature-of-channels-in-go.html https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/222642/are-go-langs-goroutine-pools-just-green-threads 理由 5：编译速度快 用 Go 编写的最大的微服务项目只需 6 秒就可以编译完成。与 Java 和 C 等语言的龟速（turtle-speed）编译相比，Go 的极快编译速度是它的主要生产力。 理由 6：组件团队的能力 让我们从这些数据开始：Go 的开发人员没有 C 和 Java 的开发人员多。根据 StackOverflow 的统计，有 38％的开发人员使用 Java，19.3％的开发人员使用 C，但只有 4.6％的开发人员使用 Go。GitHub 数据也显示出了类似的趋势：Go 比 Erlang、Scala 和 Elixir 等语言使用得更广泛，但不如 Java 和 C 那么流行。 幸运的是，Go 是一门非常简单易学的语言。它只提供了我们需要的基本功能，而没有提供其他附加功能。它引入了一些新概念，例如“ defer ”声明和内置的“go routines”以及 Channels 并发管理等。团队中的任何 Python、Elixir、C、Scala 或 Java 开发人员都可以在一个月内学习会怎么使用 Go 编程，因为 Go 非常简单。 与其他语言相比，我们发现建立 Go 开发团队更加容易。如果我们在竞争激烈的环境中（例如在博尔德和阿姆斯特丹）招聘，这是一个非常重要的优势。 理由 7：强大的生态系统 生态系统对于我们这样规模的团队（大约 20 人）来说非常重要。如果你不得不重新设计所有的功能，你就不能为你的客户创造价值。Go 为我们经常使用的工具提供了强大的支持。例如，Redis、RabbitMQ、PostgreSQL、模板解析、任务调度、表达式解析和 DBRocks 都可以使用现有的库。 与其他新语言（例如 Rust 或 Elixir）相比，Go 具有巨大的生态系统优势。尽管它不能与 Java、Python 或 Node 相提并论，但是我们是可以找到许多能够满足基本需求的高质量软件包。 理由 8：Gofmt，强制代码格式化 Gofmt 是一个优秀的命令行程序，它内置于 Go 编译器中，可用于格式化代码。在功能方面，它类似于 Python 的 autopep 8。我们大多数人都不喜欢争论制表符（tabs）和空格（spaces），但格式化的目标始终是一致的，实际的格式标准则无关紧要。Gofmt 以一种形式化的方式来格式化代码，以避免所有这些争论。 理由 9：gRPC 以及 Protocol Buffers Go 为 Protocol Buffers 和 gRPC 提供了一流的支持。它将这两个工具完美地结合在一起，构建了一个通过 RPC 进行通信的微服务。我们只需编写一个定义了 RPC 调用及其参数的清单文件，服务端和客户端就可以据此自动生成适当的代码了。这不仅速度快，而且网络占用空间小，使用起来更方便。 其他语言（如 C、Java、Python 和 Ruby）中的客户端代码也可以基于相同的清单文件生成。这样，就不会与内部 REST 接口发生冲突了，而且我们也不必每次都编写几乎相同的客户端和服务端代码。 使用 Golang 的缺点 缺点 1 ：缺乏框架 Go 不像 Ruby 的 Rails、Python 或 Django 或 PHP 的 Laravel，它没有一个主要的框架。这个话题在 Go 社区引起了激烈的争论，许多人认为不应该使用现有的框架来启动项目。在某些情况下，我完全同意这一点。但是，如果我们想要构建一个简单的 CRUD API，那么使用 Django/DJRF、Rails Laravel 或 Phoenix 则会更简单。 缺点 2：错误处理 Go 通过简单地从函数中返回错误的形式来处理错误。尽管这种方案是可行的，但是它很容易失去错误的范围，从而很难向用户提供有价值的错误信息。错误包可以通过返回错误的上下文和错误堆栈来解决该问题。 还有一个问题，那就是它很容易忘记去处理错误。尽管诸如 errcheck 和 megacheck 之类的静态分析工具可以避免这些错误，但这始终并不完善。也许我们应该期待一种语言级别的错误处理方案。 缺点 3：包管理 Go 的包管理并不完善。默认情况下，它无法指定依赖项的特定版本，也无法创建可重用的构建方案。Python、Node 和 Ruby 都有更好的包管理系统。但是，如果能使用正确的工具，Go 的包管理也可以变得更简单。 我们可以使用 Dep 来管理指定固定版本的依赖项。此外，我们还提供了一个名为 VirtualGo 的开源工具，用于多项目管理。 Python vs Go 我们做了一个有趣的实验，用 Go 重写了原来由 Python 编写的 feed 流。请看一下该排序方法的示例： Python 和 Go 的代码都需要执行如下操作来支持此排序方法： 解析分数表达式，将“simple_gauss”转换为函数，输入活动并输出分数 通过 JSON 配置创建函数。例如，我们想要“simple_gauss”在 scale 为 5 天、offset 为 1 天、factor 为 0.3 时调用“decay_gauss”。 当字段没有值时，解析“defaults”配置并采用默认值。 从步骤 1 开始使用该函数，对 feed 中的所有活动进行评分。 开发 Python 版的排序（Sort ）代码花了大约三天的时间，其中包括代码编写、单元测试和文档编写。接下来，我们花了大约 2 周的时间来优化代码。其中一种优化方法是将分数表达式 simple_gauss(time)*popularity 转换为抽象语法树。我们还实现了可用于预测分数的缓存逻辑。 相比之下，开发此代码的 Go 版花了大约四天的时间，并且在后期不需要进一步地优化性能。因此，尽管 Python 最初的开发速度更快，但是 Go 版最终需要的工作量更少。另一个优势是，Go 代码比我们高度优化的 Python 代码还要快 40 倍。 当然，这只是说明我们切换到 Go 后性能提升的一个简单示例： 排序代码是我用 Go 编写的第一个项目。 Go 代码是在 Python 代码之后编写的，因此对项目的理解更加深入。 Go 的表达式解析库的质量更高 你的经历可能会有所不同。与 Python 相比，使用 Go 构建系统中的某些其他组件需要花费更多的时间。通常，编写 Go 代码需要付出更多的努力。但是，优化代码性能所需的时间会更少。 Elixir vs Go 我们想要评估的另一种语言是 Elixir 。Elixir 是一门建立在 Erlang 虚拟机上的引人入胜的语言。我之所以这么说，是因为我们的一个项目团队非常精通该语言。 出于这个原因，我们注意到 Go 的原始性能更好。Go 和 Elixir 都能支持数千个并发请求。但是，如果我们查看单个请求的性能，Go 要快得多。我们选择 Go 的另一个原因是它的生态系统。对于我们需要的组件来说，Go 具有更成熟的库，而 Elixir 尚不适合用于生产。同时，也很难招聘到 Elixir 开发人员或对开发人员进行 Elixir 培训。 结 论 Go 是一种性能非常高的语言，并且它对并发的支持非常强大。它差不多与 C 和 Java 一样快了。尽管 Go 的编译速度比 Python 或 Ruby 慢，但我们可以节省出大量的优化代码时间。 Go 对于新手而言具有庞大的生态系统，它易于学习使用，具有超高的性能，并且对并发有强大的支持，此外，它还具有非常高效的开发环境。这些特性使 Go 成为开发人员最合适的选择。 参考阅读： https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/nine-reasons-to-switch-from-python-to-go-f1b0cd746974 " />

sudo apt install -y snapd sudo snap install snapcraft --edge --classic /snap/bin/snapcraft 这个例子使用了 machine 执行器来安装用于管理运行 snap 的可执行程序 snapd 和制作 snap 的 snapcraft 工具。 由于构建过程需要使用比较新的内核，所以我们使用了 machine 执行器而没有用 docker 执行器。在这里，Linux v4.4 已经足够满足我们的需求了。 用户空间的依赖关系 上面的例子使用了 machine 执行器，它实际上是一个内核为 Linux v4.4 的 Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) 虚拟机。如果 Trusty 仓库可以满足你的 project/snap 构建依赖，那就没问题。如果你的构建依赖需要其他版本，比如 Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)，我们仍然可以在 machine 执行器中使用 Docker 来构建我们的 snap 软件包 。 version: 2 jobs: build: machine: true working_directory: ~/project steps: - checkout - run: command: | sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y snapd docker run -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -t ubuntu:xenial sh -c &quot;apt update -qq &amp;&amp; apt install snapcraft -y &amp;&amp; cd $(pwd) &amp;&amp; snapcraft&quot; 这个例子中，我们再次在 machine 执行器的虚拟机中安装了 snapd，但是我们决定将 snapcraft 安装在 Ubuntu Xenial 镜像构建的 Docker 容器中，并使用它来构建我们的 snap。这样，在 snapcraft 运行的过程中就可以使用在 Ubuntu 16.04 中可用的所有 apt 包。 测试 在我们的博客、文档以及互联网上已经有很多讲述如何对软件代码进行单元测试的内容。搜索你的语言或者框架和单元测试或者 CI 可以找到大量相关的信息。在 CircleCI 上构建 snap 软件包，我们最终会得到一个 .snap 的文件，这意味着除了创造它的代码外我们还可以对它进行测试。 工作流 假设我们构建的 snap 软件包是一个 webapp，我们可以通过测试套件来确保构建的 snap 可以正确的安装和运行，我们也可以试着安装它或者使用 Selenium 来测试页面加载、登录等功能正常工作。但是这里有一个问题，由于 snap 是被设计成可以在多个 Linux 发行版上运行，这就需要我们的测试套件可以在 Ubuntu 16.04、Fedora 25 和 Debian 9 等发行版中可以正常运行。这个问题我们可以通过 CircleCI 2.0 的工作流来有效地解决。 工作流是在最近的 CircleCI 2.0 测试版中加入的，它允许我们通过特定的逻辑流程来运行离散的任务。这样，使用单个任务构建完 snap 后，我们就可以开始并行的运行 snap 的发行版测试任务，每个任务对应一个不同的发行版的 Docker 镜像 (或者在将来，还会有其他可用的执行器)。 这里有一个简单的例子： workflows: version: 2 build-test-and-deploy: jobs: - build - acceptance_test_xenial: requires: - build - acceptance_test_fedora_25: requires: - build - acceptance_test_arch: requires: - build - publish: requires: - acceptance_test_xenial - acceptance_test_fedora_25 - acceptance_test_arch 在这个例子中首先构建了 snap，然后在四个不同的发行版上运行验收测试。如果所有的发行版都通过测试了，那么我们就可以运行发布 job，以便在将其推送到 snap 商店之前完成剩余的 snap 任务。 留着 .snap 包 为了测试我们在工作流示例中使用的 .snap 软件包，我们需要一种在构建的时候持久保存 snap 的方法。在这里我将提供两种方法： artifact —— 在运行 build 任务的时候我们可以将 snaps 保存为一个 CircleCI 的 artifact（LCTT 译注：artifact 是 snapcraft.yaml 中的一个 Plugin-specific 关键字），然后在接下来的任务中检索它。CircleCI 工作流有自己处理共享 artifact 的方式，相关信息可以在 这里 找到。 snap 商店通道 —— 当发布 snap 软件包到 snap 商店时，有多种通道可供我们选择。将 snap 的主分支发布到 edge 通道以供内部或者用户测试已经成为一种常见做法。我们可以在 build 任务中完成这些工作，然后接下来的的任务就可以从 edge 通道来安装构建好的 snap 软件包。 第一种方法速度更快，并且它还可以在 snap 软包上传到 snap 商店供用户甚至是测试用户使用之前对 snap 进行验收测试。第二种方法的好处是我们可以从 snap 商店安装 snap，这也是 CI 运行期间的测试项之一。 snap 商店的身份验证 snapcraft-config-generator.py 脚本可以生成商店证书并将其保存到 .snapcraft/snapcraft.cfg 中（注意：在运行公共脚本之前一定要对其进行检查）。如果觉得在你仓库中使用明文来保存这个文件不安全，你可以用 base64 编码该文件，并将其存储为一个私有环境变量，或者你也可以对文件 进行加密，并将密钥存储在一个私有环境变量中。 下面是一个示例，将商店证书放在一个加密的文件中，并在 deploy 环节中使用它将 snap 发布到 snap 商店中。 - deploy: name: Push to Snap Store command: | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in .snapcraft/snapcraft.encrypted -out .snapcraft/snapcraft.cfg -k $KEY /snap/bin/snapcraft push *.snap 除了 deploy 任务之外，工作流示例同之前的一样， deploy 任务只有当验收测试任务通过时才会运行。 更多的信息 Alan Pope 在 论坛中发的帖子：“popey” 是 Canonical 的员工，他在 snapcraft 的论坛上写了这篇文章，并启发作者写了这篇博文。 snapcraft 网站： snapcraft 官方网站。 snapcraft 的 CircleCI Bug 报告：在 Launchpad 上有一个开放的 bug 报告页面，用来改善 CircleCI 对 snapcraft 的支持。同时这将使这个过程变得更简单并且更“正式”。期待您的支持。 怎么使用 CircleCI 构建 Nextcloud 的 snap：这里有一篇题为 “复杂应用的持续验收测试” 的博文，它同时也影响了这篇博文。 这篇客座文章的作者是 Ricardo Feliciano —— CircleCi 的开发者传道士。如果您也有兴趣投稿，请联系 ubuntu-iot@canonical.com。原始文章可以从 这里 找到。 via: https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/06/28/build-test-and-publish-snap-packages-using-snapcraft/ 译者简介： 常年混迹于 snapcraft.io，对 Ubuntu Core、snaps 和 snapcraft 有浓厚的兴趣，并致力于将这些还在快速发展的新技术通过翻译或原创的方式介绍到中文世界。有兴趣的小伙伴也可以关注译者个人的公众号： Snapcraft 作者：Ricardo Feliciano 译者：Snapcrafter 校对：wxy 本文由 LCTT 原创编译，Linux中国 荣誉推出 发表评论 评论 最新评论 发表评论 来自北京中央财经大学的 Chrome 60.0|GNU/Linux 用户 2017-08-20 17:40 5 赞 回复 这玩意本身不是个自由开源软件 译自：insights.ubuntu.com 作者： Ricardo Feliciano 原创：LCTT https://linux.cn/article-8788-1.html 译者： Snapcrafter 本文由 LCTT 原创翻译，Linux 中国首发。也想加入译者行列，为开源做一些自己的贡献么？欢迎加入 LCTT！ 翻译工作和译文发表仅用于学习和交流目的，翻译工作遵照 CC-BY-SA 协议规定，如果我们的工作有侵犯到您的权益，请及时联系我们。 欢迎遵照 CC-BY-SA 协议规定 转载，敬请在正文中标注并保留原文/译文链接和作者/译者等信息。 文章仅代表作者的知识和看法，如有不同观点，请楼下排队吐槽 :D 上一篇：Linux 包管理基础：apt、yum、dnf 和 pkg下一篇：了解 7z 命令开关（一） LCTT 译者 Snapcrafter 🌟🌟 共计翻译： 6.5 篇 | 共计贡献： 27 天 贡献时间：2017-08-03 -&gt;
