                            By Joshua Yehl and Hilary Goldstein                        </span>
                    </span>It's <a class="autolink" title="Batman" href="urn:scrapbook-download-error:file:///web/20170323203328/http://www.ign.com/characters/batman" data-legacy-id="">Batman</a>'s 75th anniversary! To celebrate, we are updating our list of the 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels.</p> <p>Batman has more graphic novels than any other hero, so there were many, many stories read in order to compile this list. It's worth noting that this is an update of former IGN Comics Editor Hilary Goldstein's list from 2011. Choice additions and subtractions were made to the list, as well as a change-up in the order -- including a brand new #1.</p> <p>With Grant Morrison finishing his epic run on Batman, we entered his most lasting addition to the Batman mythos -- Batman and Son -- to the list. Also added were Batman: The Black Mirror by Scott Snyder, Jock, and Francesco Francavilla and <a class="autolink" title="Batman: Earth One" href="urn:scrapbook-download-error:file:///web/20170323203328/http://www.ign.com/comics/batman-earth-one" data-legacy-id="">Batman: Earth One</a> by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank, but you'll have to check out the list to see where they landed. Sorry, still no Batman: Mad Love by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm; it’s a great story but more notable for its Harley Quinn material than Batman.</p> <p>Snyder and Greg Capullo are currently doing a fantastic job with their Batman run, but we are waiting until they are completely done before considering any of their work for this list.</p> <p>There were dozens of other noteworthy Batman graphic novels that were considered, but in the end, this is our list of the 25 Batman stories every comics fan should read.</p> <p><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="articleSubHeader icon-pointy">Our Criteria</div> <p><!-- poilib end -->  When making our selections, it became necessary to set up some ground rules. After all, Batman's adventures go beyond his own books. Do we count the <span class="autolink">JLA</span>? What about something like Robin: Year One? Books were weighed against four criteria.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Format -</strong> Though we call this list "The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels," it's in a loose sense. Prestige format books (such as The Killing Joke), graphic novels (Son of the Demon) and trade paperbacks (Tales of the Demon) are all eligible.</li> <li><strong>A Batman Story -</strong> Batman needs to be involved in the story as a vital character. We love books such as Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood and Batman: Birth of the Demon, but these great tales are origins of other characters that scarcely utilize the Dark Knight. A JLA or any other story is eligible, provided Batman is in the lead role.</li> <li><strong>A Good Read -</strong> Sometimes too much importance is placed on the significance of a story rather than the quality of the storytelling. A story needs to be compelling beyond just the plot twists.</li> <li><strong>Indelible Mark -</strong> Great stories are unforgettable. It's not enough just to be a good read, each of these books must linger in our memories. Every book on this list has stayed with us even after the last page was read. These are books you tell people, "You just have to read this, if not your life will have less meaning."</li> </ul> <p><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">25</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Earth One by Geoff Johns &amp; Gary Frank</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="e51cc6be0a7abf2.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --></p> <p dir="ltr">If Batman: Year One were written today, it would be Batman: Earth One. It’s a modern retelling of Batman’s early years where he’s not an infallible master detective who moves like a shadow -- a point driven home when, while chasing a crook over the city rooftops, his grappling gun malfunctions and he lands in a pile of trash below. Also, instead of being best buds with Jim Gordon, he winds up socking him in the face.</p> <p>The crucial element that makes this story work is the overhaul of Alfred Pennyworth’s character. No longer a kindly butler, Alfred is an ex-MI-6 agent who, instead of serving him tea and tending to his wounds, beats the crap out of Bruce to teach him a lesson. It’s a refreshing spin on the classic dynamic that lets us appreciate how Batman would adapt to a world with more realistic limitations.</p> <p><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">24</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Nine Lives by Dean Motter &amp; Michael Lark</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="899e74e6125b401.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --></p> <p dir="ltr">Who killed Selina Kyle? That's what private detective Dick Grayson and the mysterious Batman hope to discover. These two might be partners in another universe, but in Nine Lives, Grayson doesn't care much for the Batman and the Batman, well, he doesn't care much for anyone.</p> <p>Noir is a natural fit for Batman villains. Joker becomes a two-bit card shark, Harvey Dent a two-faced lawyer, the Penguin a mob boss, and Mr. Freeze a stone cold hitman. The fun noir twists on Batman's Rogues Gallery is great, but Grayson's the one who shines here. He has never been as visceral, fun, and interesting as he is here.</p> <p><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">23</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: The Man Who Laughs by Ed Brubaker &amp; Doug Mahnke</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="05013f8ca77c7a1.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --></p> <p dir="ltr">A mad man is targeting Gotham's elite and next on his hit list is millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. This is Batman's introduction to his most nefarious villain, the Joker. Where Alan Moore's The Killing Joke tells the origin of the Clown Prince of Crime, The Man Who Laughs details the first tussle between Joker and Batman.</p> <p>Brubaker is one of the best crime writers in comics. He manages to bring some of that noir flair to The Man Who Laughs while maintaining the proper tone and pace for a good Batman yarn. To my knowledge this is the only story to ever suggest that, like Bruce Wayne, the Joker had to practice to perfect his art. And that's ultimately what makes the Joker so frightening. His psychosis is not chaotic, not as random as you might think. There's a methodology and a purposefulness to many of his actions.</p> <p><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">22</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Venom by Dennis O'Neil, Trevor Von Eeden &amp; Russell Braun</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="5ba8819af643388.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --></p> <p dir="ltr">Venom opens with one of the biggest failures in Batman's career. A little girl is trapped. Drowning. And Batman isn't strong enough to save her. Distraught, the Dark Knight finds a new alternative to strength training -- a little pill that triples his strength. Of course, it's highly addictive and the always-in-control hero loses his grip, nearly assassinating Jim Gordon just to get his fix. It's a look at a side of Batman we rarely see.</p> <p>Venom is one of those stories that is a struggle to rank. The premise is stronger than the actual writing. Batman fights a shark. So, there's that. But there are moments, strong moments, where O'Neil tests the limits of Batman's commitment to his crusade. And it's enough to make Venom one of the more memorable Batman stories ever told.</p> <p><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">21</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Thrillkiller by Howard Chaykin &amp; Dan Brereton</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="0ecfdb3cfc8e6cd.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --></p> <p dir="ltr">During a time of political and social turmoil, the citizens of Gotham put their hopes on the city's Dynamic Duo to maintain order. Only this time it’s Batgirl and Robin. Set in the early <a class="autolink" title="" href="urn:scrapbook-download-error:file:///web/20170323203328/http://www.ign.com/comics/batman-and-son-tpb" data-legacy-id=""></a>'60s, this Elseworlds story imagines the Joker as a hot babe, Bruce Wayne as a reluctant hero, and Barbara Gordon as a tormented crusader of vengeance. As if that weren't enough, there's a really awkward sex scene between Bruce Wayne and Black Canary.</p> <p>Thrillkiller takes familiar characters and nudges them slightly to the left, creating surprises at nearly every turn of the page. No Gotham City denizen is quite their true selves here, but none are so far removed as to be unbelievable. What that really means is that you have a story that offers a fresh take on the Batman mythos. It still feels new even after nearly 15 years.<span id="article-punctuation" class="article-punctuation">

This is how the second Robin met his end at the hand of the Joker.</p> <p dir="ltr">Jason Todd was a jerk. Let's get that out there right now. Anyone who read stories with him dressed in red and yellow knows he was not a great Robin. But his death feels undeserved. It seems wrong, even though the ending to this story never changes. And maybe that's what makes it remain memorable, more than 20 years later. The image of a lifeless Robin cradled in <a class="autolink" title="Batman" href="urn:scrapbook-download-error:file:///web/20170331111249/http://www.ign.com/characters/batman" data-legacy-id="">Batman</a>'s arms still gives me goose bumps.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">19</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman and the Monster Men by Matt Wagner</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="77c1b378a3b4877.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">A year into his crime-fighting career, Batman has only faced mobsters, thugs, and a few crazies. Monster Men is Batman's first encounter with anything super-human. Hugo Strange is creating monstrous creatures, stronger than the Dark Knight and with a mindless thirst for blood. Now, Batman must adapt to a new kind of villain. This is the moment where Batman goes from street legend onto the path of superhero.</p> <p dir="ltr">The best Batman books push the Caped Crusader to his limits. This story is about Bruce Wayne learning he has limits.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">18</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying by Marv Wolfman, George Perez, Jim Aparo &amp; Tom Grummett</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="17ab8cfec92f694.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Dick Grayson and Jason Todd became Robin out of circumstance. They didn't really choose the role, it was chosen for them. Tim Drake is different. He takes an active role in becoming the third Robin. A Lonely Place of Dying isn't just an origin tale of Robin #3, it's the best response to the question: "Why does Batman need Robin?"</p> <p dir="ltr">The answer, it turns out, isn't to keep Batman from the dark side or as some subconscious way of restoring Bruce Wayne's lost youth. When Batman has to consider the safety of a young sidekick, he's more likely to think things through. He'll take more precautions. He'll be safer. Robin, just by virtue of being at his side, keeps Batman alive a little longer. Now, if that doesn't make you want to read the only worthwhile Robin origin, you just don't like Batman stories.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">17</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Strange Apparitions by Steve Englehart, Len Wein, Marshall Rogers &amp; Walt Simonson</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="f5683ca818cc2dc.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">If you haven't read Strange Apparitions, chances are you've never heard of Bruce Wayne's best love interest, Silver St. Cloud. She's smart enough to deduce Batman's true identity and strong enough to break the Batman's heart. And that's just part of the mix in this great tale from the late <a class="autolink" title="" href="urn:scrapbook-download-error:file:///web/20170331111249/http://www.ign.com/comics/batman-and-son-tpb" data-legacy-id=""></a>'70s featuring underappreciated lunatic Hugo Strange (back from the dead) and the Joker (creating more dead). Plus, as a bonus, you get to see Hugo Strange dressed as Batman.</p> <p dir="ltr">Batman: Year One gets a little too much credit for "reinventing Batman." The truth is that there were great Batman stories before Year One. This is the best you'll find from the pre-Year One era that's been collected in a TPB. And it serves as a worthwhile introduction to Hugo Strange.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">16</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Gothic by Grant Morrison &amp; Klaus Janson</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="af4b8d317443f76.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Where did Bruce Wayne go to school? We know about Wayne's training to become the Batman, but in Gothic, we get a glimpse into Bruce Wayne's life before his parents were murdered. This ties into a series of grisly murders in Batman's early days in the cape and cowl.</p> <p dir="ltr">Gothic is a detective story, a horror story, and a thriller that teams Morrison with the great Klaus Janson. Religion and Batman aren't married in comics as often as they should be. Morrison plays it perfectly. For those a little worried about a "Morrison head-trip," relax. Nothing in these pages will damage your brain… too much.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">15</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Knightfall by Various Artists and Writers</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="1bdabce22bc1ca3.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">[Editor’s Note: For the purposes of this list, Knightfall is referring to all three parts of the “KnightSaga” -- Knightfall, Knightquest, and KnightEnd. Yes, we are including three graphic novels in one entry. Give us a break on this one!]</p> <p dir="ltr">Knightfall is an example of a story that overcomes the shortcomings of its art and writing, which were flawed if only because of several change-ups over its publication. The story is so essential to Batman’s character that it was the main inspiration for The Dark Knight Rises movie, further expanding its popularity and cementing it as a classic.</p> <p dir="ltr">In Knightfall, Bane breaks out all of Arkham Asylum’s criminals to exhaust Batman, and then once he’s worn out, he breaks his back over his knee. Ouch. What follows next is why the story made this list. Batman hands over the mantle to Jean-Paul Valley aka Azreal, who soon loses his mind and starts killing criminals. Batman must train and rebuild himself from the ground up with help from Lady Shiva, and then he returns to Gotham to reclaim his mantle from Azreal.</p> <p dir="ltr">The story shows why Bruce Wayne’s morality makes him the ideal Batman. He is uniquely suited to be the kind of hero that Gotham needs, which is made plain by juxtaposing him with the murderous Azreal.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">14</div> <h3 class="headline">Justice League of America: Tower of Babel by Mark Waid &amp; Howard Porter</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="8490cbeae84b5d4.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Two stories solidified the notion that Batman can kick anyone's ass. The first was Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, where Batman outwits and outduels Superman, the other is Mark Waid's excellent JLA story, Tower of Babel.</p> <p dir="ltr">Batman, we discover, has a plan for everything. That includes what to do if any of his allies in the Justice League go rogue. He's prepared to take down any of his friends when necessary. And when an enemy unlocks those secret plans and uses them against the JLA, we get to see Batman's obsessive planning come to fruition.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">13</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Black &amp; White by Various Artists &amp; Writers</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="52ae6c8e80ce478.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Here's a novel concept: Take the best writers and artists in comics, give them only a handful of pages to work with, and ask them to create complete and compelling stories about the Dark Knight. The result is the fascinating, varied, and sometimes hilarious Batman: Black &amp; White. If Batman's legend were a diamond, this book would show you every facet.</p> <p dir="ltr">Some of the stories in B&amp;W are larks, some are very serious. Each shows a slightly different side of the Batman. My personal favorite is the Neil Gaiman/Simon Bisley romp "A Black &amp; White World" which imagines Joker and Batman as actors playing out parts within the pages of a comic book.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">12</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman and Son by Grant Morrison &amp; Andy Kubert</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="2069f702fe347f4.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Grant Morrison’s Batman epic has come to a close, and we feel strongly that the material collected in Batman and Son best encapsulates his best and most lasting addition to the Batman mythos: Damian Wayne. He is the lovechild of Bruce Wayne and Talia Al Ghul, genetically engineered to be perfect and trained by the League of Assassins to one day replace his father. He treats Alfred like an indentured servant, kills crooks instead of arresting them, and wants to kill Tim Drake to take his place as Robin.</p> <p dir="ltr">Who knew that one of Batman’s greatest challenges would be attempting to raise a spoiled, violent child he didn’t even know existed? It would be a silly PG-rated movie if it weren’t so darkly told by Grant Morrison. Damian makes an excellent source of antagonism throughout the story, but in dealing with his son’s extreme behavior, Batman shows a personal side to him rarely glimpsed while also reinforcing Batman’s code of ethics.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">11</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Gotham By Gaslight by Brian Augustyn &amp; Mike Mignola</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="e9cb155675e048e.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Set in the Victorian era, the origin of Batman hasn't changed much in Gotham By Gaslight. Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered, he travelled abroad to train so that he could return to Gotham as its protector. Only catch is that while Bruce was in London, a madman was on the loose cutting up prostitutes. And when Bruce returns home to Gotham, the murders follow him. If you're going to suspect someone of slashing up ladies with a scalpel, why not the eccentric son of a doctor? After all, can Bruce Wayne explain his nocturnal habits?</p> <p dir="ltr">Gotham By Gaslight is a tightly woven mystery that never tries to do too much. Sometimes Elseworlds tales throw in every bit of Batman lore and the Cray computers to boot. Wisely, Augustyn sticks to what makes sense for the story and pulls off one of the better tales in Batman's long history.</p> <p dir="ltr">

                <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">10</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Hush by Jeph Loeb &amp; Jim Lee</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="180769ad7d2c46e.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Jeph Loeb has mastered the lengthy storyline that cycles through <a class="autolink" title="Batman" href="urn:scrapbook-download-error:file:///web/20170421202916/http://www.ign.com/characters/batman" data-legacy-id="">Batman</a>'s Rogues Gallery. Usually these are stories from Batman's past, but Hush is a modern tale that uses some of the same clever gimmicks as The Long Halloween. We're left to wonder at the identity of a new mastermind villain named Hush who's playing all of Batman's old enemies in an effort to ruin the Dark Knight's life. It's a mystery with a controversial resolution, but if the journey is what matters, well, then Hush belongs on the list of the 25 must-read Batman books.</p> <p dir="ltr">While we’re not a big fan of how Hush resolves itself, the individual pieces are brilliant. This is one of the few Batman stories to give some notable page space to explore the Batman/Catwoman relationship with some depth, which makes it noteworthy by itself. The real star, though, is Jim Lee's art, which just might be his best work in his time at DC Comics.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">9</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: The Black Mirror by Scott Snyder, Jock &amp; Francesco Francavilla</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="3b9d11389a19cd4.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">One of the more recently published stories on this list, The Black Mirror tells two distinct stories drawn by two different artists -- both masters in their own right -- and then marries them together in the end with an unexpected (and polarizing) twist.</p> <p dir="ltr">Most notable -- and potentially blasphemous -- is that this story stars Dick Grayson under the cowl instead of Bruce Wayne, who at the time was believed dead. Commissioner Gordon isn’t happy with it, but over the course of the story they form a bond not unlike the one with Bruce in Batman: Year One.</p> <p dir="ltr">But the true obstacle for this new Batman comes in the form of James Gordon Jr., the Commissioner’s psychotic murderer of a son and modern day classic villain. Thanks to him, the tale is steeped in horror and full of deftly executed twists, not to mention the mystery he is responsible for is one that even Bruce would have had trouble with.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">8</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Year 100 by Paul Pope</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="835afa8ab422f93.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">The name says it all. This is Batman, set a hundred years after the original's Gotham debut. Sadly, Gotham City is no better than it was a century ago. The police are still ravaged by corruption and too much of the city is gripped by poverty. But there is hope. There is a Batman. At least, that's the myth. No, this isn't Bruce Wayne at 120 years old. This is a new man in the suit, with a new Robin. But as we learn, the cape and cowl have become part of a legacy. A legacy most of Gotham has forgotten. Well, they're about to get a reminder.</p> <p dir="ltr">Year 100 is different. Not just because it's set in the future. This is the rare Batman story that doesn't try to hang tight to the Bruce Wayne version of Batman. It's fresh and new and exciting. And yet, it has some very clear connections to Batman: Year One, keeping this wild fantasy of a futuristic Dark Knight tethered to the core mythology.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">7</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Dark Victory by Jeph Loeb &amp; Tim Sale</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="fc8347fdb82182f.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Sequel to the wildly successful Long Halloween, Dark Victory offers another year-long look into Batman's early career. It is a continuation of Long Halloween, picking up on some loose threads from the original and doesn't stand quite as well on its own. The biggest addition is Robin. The Boy Wonder's origin is retold in more depth than ever before. Why would Batman want a partner? No, the real question is: Why would anyone want to partner with Batman?</p> <p dir="ltr">What stands strongest in Dark Victory is the smart and effective re-imagining of the first Robin's origin. We tend to accept that Dick Grayson became Robin because he was adopted by Batman. That's pretty shallow reasoning. Dark Victory gives us a little more substance.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">6</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Red Rain by Doug Moench &amp; Kelley Jones</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="0392c6e53fb4776.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">A scourge of the undead has hit Gotham City, turning its lowliest citizens into vampire warriors. The only thing keeping the vamps from turning Gotham into a buffet is Batman. One problem -- he's been infected too. Batman has often been called a creature of the night. In Red Rain, that's literal. Batman's challenge is two-fold: Stop the vamps from taking over the city and resist the urge to break his "one rule" and feed on another human being.</p> <p dir="ltr">Long before True Blood, the vampire craze hit comics thanks to the almost abstract art of Kelley Jones and the heavy inks of Malcolm Jones III. Batman's ears never stood so tall before. In another artist's hands, Red Rain might read like a farce. But this is an example of the perfect marriage between story and art.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">5</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Son of the Demon by Mike W. Barr &amp; Jerry Bingham</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="96f82a0b2c3956d.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">When Batman and his nemesis Ra's al Ghul find themselves chasing the same assassin, the two form an unexpected partnership. One that reunites Batman with Talia al Ghul, one of his stronger love interests. Is Batman ready to have a father-in-law like Ra's al Ghul? To become a father himself? The answer may surprise you.</p> <p dir="ltr">People love the Joker and claim he is the perfect foil for the Batman. However, Ra's al Ghul can be the best Batman villain if the proper writer gets a hold of him. That's what you get with Son of the Demon, the perfect Ra's al Ghul tale. It's a brilliant, perfectly paced story that also happens to be the origin for the newest (and most interesting) Robin. For years, this book was impossible to find, but thanks to the introduction of Batman's son, Damian Wayne, Son of the Demon has been reprinted and is now readily available.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">4</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: The Long Halloween by Jeph Loeb &amp; Tim Sale</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="11a02d1abf77539.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Someone in Gotham's decided to make a killing during the holidays. Each issue tackles another holiday as the year winds round. This new holiday killer has the mob, the cops, Arkham's crazies and the Batman all on edge. The Long Halloween is both a great mystery, among the best told in Batman's long history, and a new look at the Dark Knight's early career, when the status quo of Gotham City was changing.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Long Halloween has all the ingredients of a classic Batman story: A mysterious killer, appearances by notable villains, striking visuals, and an imperfect ending to the case. Special credit to Loeb for making one of the dumbest characters ever created, Calendar Man, appear interesting and necessary.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">3</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: The Killing Joke by Alan Moore &amp; Brian Bolland</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="0eaec5787480eb7.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">The Joker. Batman's greatest foe. His goal is chaos, but the beauty of his madness is the incredible amount of thought he puts into each caper. In the Killing Joke, the Clown Prince of Crime decides he wants to prove that, given the right push, anyone would fall into madness. To go about this, he torments down-to-earth Jim Gordon. All the while, we're given glimpses into the Joker's origin and see what pushed him over the edge.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Killing Joke isn't just a brilliant origin story for comics' most famed villain, it also clearly defines what separates the good guys from the crazy guys. When push comes to shove, the sane ones shove back; the crazies allow themselves to go over the edge.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">2</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: Year One by Frank Miller &amp; David Mazzucchelli</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="d485caca5a78ea2.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">Who would dress up like a bat and prance around the city fighting crime? We all know that answer. Who would stand by his side? That's the story we learn in Year One. Batman and Gordon arrive in Gotham around the same time, both carrying a lot of baggage. Though they spend the year making their fair share of mistakes, they form an uneasy partnership, one that will last throughout their careers.</p> <p dir="ltr">Whenever a new Batman movie is announced, the first question is always: "Who's the villain?" And yet, the best Batman story of all time remains the one that features no marquee villains. At best, you get a cameo from Selina Kyle. Otherwise, this is a story about two men trying to do right in a city where everything has gone wrong. Perhaps that's what makes it so strong. There's no reliance on campy villains or a threat that would wipe out all of Gotham. This is street crime and corruption. This is the impossible battle, the one Batman and Jim Gordon can never win.</p> <p dir="ltr"><!-- poilib start --></p> <div class="objectRanking"> <div class="objectInfo"> <div class="rank">1</div> <h3 class="headline">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller</h3> </div> <div class="imageURL"><img src="89196f25554c865.jpeg"></div> </div> <p><!-- poilib end --> </p> <p dir="ltr">This is the one where Batman kicks Superman's ass. Set a decade after Batman's retirement, The Dark Knight Returns offers a grim vision of the future of Gotham City. Times are bleak and Gotham is in need of a hero. And Bruce Wayne? Well, he's been fighting his obsession for a decade. He simply can't hold out any longer. He puts the suit back on to face off against his oldest foe and his oldest friend.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Dark Knight Returns is a masterpiece of comic-book storytelling. The pages are packed, sometimes with dozens of panels. Overcrowded, even. And yet, Miller creates a distinct pacing through each page and builds to perhaps the most optimistic ending in any Batman story. Yeah, Frank Miller ends with a touch of optimism.</p> <p dir="ltr">For being just as entertaining the first time we read it as the last, creating the definitive dark and moody characterization of the Caped Crusader that is still channeled to this day, and for answering the age old question of "Who would win, Batman or Superman?", The Dark Knight Returns is the greatest Batman graphic novel of all time.<span id="article-punctuation" class="article-punctuation">
