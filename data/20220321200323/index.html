<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Moo celebrates the
legendary voice’s birthday.</b>
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3LLuzX6E_1M/YAQgqpGIZzI/AAAAAAAAafQ/ujvw1msjx3gVHejFqmCPUSpA-N2BFqbbQCNcBGAsYHQ/s670/tom%2Bbaker.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="tom%2Bbaker" data-original-height="554" data-original-width="670" src="4c02262b8c6a9a5.jpeg" title="tom%2Bbaker" width="600" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It’s hard to
overstate the amount of love for Tom Baker that we Doctor Who fans
have. To so many he isn’t just that guy who played the 4th Doctor –
He is simply <i>THE</i> Doctor.</p>
<br>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A big part of why he is
so beloved is his voice. It booms and echoes and fills the room, it
commands attention and is almost an established Doctor Who character
in and of itself.</p>
<br>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">So it’s no surprise
that Big Finish have made the most of the opportunity to get as much
out of him as possible. Here are ten of my favourite stories from
them that feature Tom Baker.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HtSCuYrJWmE/YAQhyfFb0cI/AAAAAAAAafY/Ang9W-NdDNA_kMZlEW3amLoExHp6kKgogCNcBGAsYHQ/s1275/someone%2Bi%2Bonce%2Bknes.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="someone%2Bi%2Bonce%2Bknes" data-original-height="1275" data-original-width="1275" src="6b5ad828473dc33.jpeg" title="someone%2Bi%2Bonce%2Bknes" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>10. Someone I Once
Knew</b></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is the concluding
story in one of Big Finish’s River Song boxsets so you need to hear
it in context to appreciate it. In this set River has been in
conflict with the demon-alien Discordia, and for the final story to
reverse the damage done she has to team up with her husband… the
wrong version, but the Doctor all the same. While there’s
essentially no reason why it has to be the Fourth Doctor, it really
works. Tom Baker and Alex Kingston play off each other really well
and together they totally sell the relationship between the two. It’s
a beautiful story, this one.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_Hp2CBUFMsw/YAQiKf7_k9I/AAAAAAAAafg/TK9RGn-pWTIvn6HrnmgyMd_NvMrhR8-HgCNcBGAsYHQ/s920/the%2Bsyndicate%2Bmasterplan.JPG" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="the%2Bsyndicate%2Bmasterplan" data-original-height="460" data-original-width="920" src="36c65535a44c7a4.jpeg" title="the%2Bsyndicate%2Bmasterplan" width="600" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>9. The Syndicate
Masterplan</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I’m not sure who
decided that a sequel to 1965-66 mostly-missing twelve-part epic The
Daleks’ Master Plan was a necessary thing in 2019, but the eighth
series of Big Finish’s Fourth Doctor Adventures range was exactly
that. The Syndicate Masterplan is a mix of standalone and arc-based
stories but they must all be heard together to appreciate it. The
overall story picks up the pieces after the First Doctor’s
adventure and throws the Fourth and his new companion WPC Ann Kelso
into the fallout. It’s a treat for fans of 60s-era Who, with lots
of great twists and turns that make for a compelling experience.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NFLFh75HbQc/YAQisC7lNtI/AAAAAAAAafo/Q2YR0gWH-jM-Yuq-NbJlfaoapcpQ7wQLwCNcBGAsYHQ/s920/the%2Bfoe%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bfuture.JPG" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="the%2Bfoe%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bfuture" data-original-height="306" data-original-width="920" src="a4cae28230b6ac4.jpeg" title="the%2Bfoe%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bfuture" width="600" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>8. The Foe From the
Future</b></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This “lost story”
was one of two six-parters considered to conclude season 14 back in
the 70s. In the end they made The Talons of Weng-Chiang, but luckily
the other option survives in the form of this Big Finish adaptation.
Despite being a six-part story without visuals it never drags, with
many changes in setting and a strong supporting cast working to keep
it moving along at pace. All the strengths of the Hinchcliffe era of
the show are on display to create a story that it’s a damn shame we
didn’t get in the 70s but that I’m really pleased we still got to
experience in this form.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G4qELJ9q81E/YAQjBVwzVQI/AAAAAAAAafw/5L39nPpYOWkmn6CV6UvEwh_Rg26Z65LmwCNcBGAsYHQ/s500/night%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bvashda.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="night%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bvashda" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="500" src="54ee4ae776e2d0a.jpeg" title="night%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bvashda" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>7. Night of the
Vashta Nerada</b></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Doctor Who visits the
happiest planet in the galaxy: Funworld. Which immediately tells you
that the story which follows will be anything but happy or fun! And
that’s not a bad thing, because it’s a great story. The imagery
is dark and morbid, but it works on audio allowing the listener to
paint a picture that a 70s budget never could. Without a companion,
this story forces the Doctor to shine on his own terms, and he does.
Seeing him work out the rules of this all-time great monster as it
slowly picks off the guest cast one by one, the Fourth Doctor is on
fine form here. A wonderful showcase for what this incarnation is
like when the pressure is really on. Any fan of Tom Baker’s Doctor
should check out this story.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8ufGw_OKo24/YAQjM7QtV_I/AAAAAAAAaf0/13lZmgs7AB0XwWpocm4S29gEJ8E5BZDzwCNcBGAsYHQ/s600/the%2Blight%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bend.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="the%2Blight%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bend" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="600" src="e8db22a4e270bfb.jpeg" title="the%2Blight%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bend" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>6. The Light at the
End</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The 50th Anniversary
audio special brings eight Doctors together, including number four.
This is a treat for fans in so many ways, but perhaps none more than
hearing Tom Baker’s Fourth Doctor team-up with Paul McGann’s
Eighth. The two spend most of the runtime together as the others go
off on their own separate tangents, resulting in what is one of the
best two-Doctor team-ups in any multi-Doctor story to date. These two
go so well together that I could easily see a full series of
adventures for them working out well. Add this to a fun story with
all the Doctors and the Master’s latest plot and you’ve got a
recipe for success.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-12cpir52pBw/YAQjZI3xF4I/AAAAAAAAaf8/4iJPd7gdGQIUmwFo93Gzy-3mOfBUq6soACNcBGAsYHQ/s600/star%2Bbeast.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="star%2Bbeast" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="600" src="49b1a90ecb1af57.jpeg" title="star%2Bbeast" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>5. Doctor Who and
the Star Beast</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is a very
different story! Adapted from an old comic strip, you know from that
fact alone that what will follow is a unique experience (and that’s
a good thing). In this story, the Doctor goes up against Beep the
Meep, a little rat-like creature who’s cutesy-cuddly appearance
covers a dark sinister evil streak. It’s exactly the sort of thing
that the TV series would never pull off but that expanded media is
placed perfectly to pull-off, making for a story that is nothing but
a delight to listen to.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XoWCF7uptmM/YAQjkcbbrQI/AAAAAAAAagE/qHsqsK7DEPEJuLyAY_n_974Cp7nvykXVwCNcBGAsYHQ/s600/out%2Bof%2Btime.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="out%2Bof%2Btime" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="600" src="0d828348f58f64c.jpeg" title="out%2Bof%2Btime" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>4. Out of Time</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Look at that cover and
then tell me if I need to justify this story’s inclusion. Tenth
Doctor and Fourth Doctor vs Daleks! What more is there to say? The
two most iconic Doctors and their most iconic villain all in one
place, sign me up! But despite all those elements, you need to have a
good story to deliver on the potential. I’m pleased to report that
that’s what we got. Although the Tenth takes the lead, the Fourth
is given plenty of good material. The setting of the story outside of
time is a terrific concept done well, and it allows for the
multi-Doctor interactions to carry the story from just being
competent fanservice into something that is essential listening.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v7_cgCy6MbE/YAQjupM9QCI/AAAAAAAAagM/3EpkEM0jN7M2q7Rb9xRXDp6Wr1FlTlSeQCNcBGAsYHQ/s600/the%2Bcrooked%2Bman.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="the%2Bcrooked%2Bman" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="600" src="1258d28c5352f90.jpeg" title="the%2Bcrooked%2Bman" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>3. The Crooked Man</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It starts off in a
coastal town where the Doctor and Leela discover a series of grisly
murders. As the pair investigate they learn of “the crooked man”,
a figure from an obscure story who feeds on imagination and lives to
kill. So how can something fictional be killing real people? The
answer is discovered when the Doctor and Leela end up in the land of
fiction, this time doing battle not with classical literary figures
but ideas by unpublished hacks. Genius idea realised to perfection,
cannot recommend it enough.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ndRZO68VUxM/YAQj5HA4prI/AAAAAAAAagU/LOMtYM8LTnsn3GR72v0ZVizwTPSiyRNMgCNcBGAsYHQ/s500/the%2Btrouble%2Bwith%2Bdrax.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="the%2Btrouble%2Bwith%2Bdrax" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="500" src="6d4fd378eb9ee41.jpeg" title="the%2Btrouble%2Bwith%2Bdrax" width="400" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>2. The Trouble With
Drax</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I’m not sure who
decided that a memorable side-character from one of the less popular
Tom Baker serials was worthy of a full-blown sequel, but I’m not
complaining. It starts off with the Doctor and Romana being recruited
by a newly-regenerated Drax for his latest scheme, and it spirals
from there. This story has one joke but the increasingly outlandish
ways it gets delivered each time will see you go from impressed to
amused to actually standing up to applaud. Proof if we needed it that
the same joke can be funny again and again if creative ways are found
to land the punchline, it’s a real achievement that a story like
this can exist and work as well as it does.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1gQ0gNO2-L4/YAQkGrB8TNI/AAAAAAAAagc/w1B_ZCWV8P8YiAp6-jr0YvQA-Pv_t8bbwCNcBGAsYHQ/s915/kill%2Bthe%2Bdoctor.JPG" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="kill%2Bthe%2Bdoctor" data-original-height="457" data-original-width="915" src="010db70f57c675b.jpeg" title="kill%2Bthe%2Bdoctor" width="600" border="0"></a></div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>1. Kill the Doctor!
/ The Age of Sutekh</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Taking a memorable
one-off villain and turning him into an idea, a purely abstract
concept rather than a tangible presence, living in a wireless cloud.
This is the sort of thing that Doctor Who should be doing with the
vast array of characters in the back catalogue of stories, and it
works really well for Sutekh the Destroyer. This two-parter is also a
great showcase for Leela giving her a very modern side-story as the
Doctor gets caught up in things. There’s a very powerful story
here, and it’s a shame how little attention it has been given
since. IMHO this is what Big Finish should be doing more of, as it tops my list of favourite Tom Baker audio adventures.<br><br>Which one is your favourite?</p>
