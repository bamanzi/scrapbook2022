<p><em>"It's a bird! No, it's a plane!"</em></p>
<p>Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to change the course of mighty rivers! Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's Superman! Co-created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster in 1938, Kal-El of Krypton is the first superhero, with all future endeavors owing a debt in one form or another to the Man of Steel since the first pages of Action Comics #1. Even in his civilian guise as Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent, Superman is the example by which all other superheroes follow.</p>

<p>After Infinite Crisis, Superman entered an era of fantastic storytelling. Geoff Johns and Richard Donner, director of 1978's Superman movie, took over Action Comics and Kurt Busiek, writer of Superman: Secret Identity, took over Superman. Both writers kick off this era of Superman with the crossover Up! Up! and Away! before beginning this legendary time in Superman history.</p>

<p>Based on the classic radio serial that turned American public opinion against the Ku Klux Klan, <em>Superman Smashes the Klan</em> is an all-ages story that takes a hard look at race relations in 1940s America. A young and developing Superman meets the Lees, a first-generation Chinese-American family, and protects them against white supremacists living in their neighborhood. Meanwhile, Superman himself learns about his own heritage, and embraces his status as an immigrant to Earth.   </p>

<p><em>Superman: Secret Identity</em> is a beautiful story about growing up, growing old, being a superhero, and being a family man.

<p>DC Comics took a bold step and renumbered the longest-running monthly comic, Action Comics, to #1 for the first time since 1938 as part of the DC Comics—The New 52 event.</p>
<p>With this renumbering comes a new creative team featuring comics legend Grant Morrison and fan-favorite artist Rag Morales. While Morrison is no stranger to writing the Superman character, having won three Eisner Award's for his work on All-Star Superman, Action Comics will be something new for both old and new readers and present humanity's first encounters with Superman, before he became one of the World's Greatest Super Heroes. Set a few years in the past, it's a bold new take on a classic hero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morrison's Action Comics is a bold origin story for Superman that deviates from many others. It captures the feel of Golden Age 1930's Superman in a modern context and integrates it with the rest of the character. Of all the origin revamps of the New 52, Morrison manages to make something strikingly modern, yet exceptionally reverent to the character.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new chapter in Superman's life begins as the challenges of Dark Nights: Death Metal are causing Clark Kent to feel...a change in his powers. Is it possible the Metropolis Marvel could be losing a step? </p>
<p>The Man of Steel’s struggles in taking down the creatures from the Breach would suggest as much! If he's going to continue to protect the people of Earth, he'll have to adapt—especially with threats like Mongul out there waiting to launch their biggest attacks on the Earth yet. After a war-torn battleship escapes Warworld and makes the perilous journey to Earth, Superman searches for answers about the identities of its mysterious refugees and their apparent link to the planet Krypton. Could there be other Kryptonians in the universe? Meanwhile, Atlantean scientists study the wreckage of the Warworld vessel…and make a shocking discovery that could change the balance of power on Earth. </p>

*"It's a bird! No, it's a plane!"*

Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to change the course of mighty rivers! Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's Superman! Co-created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster in 1938, Kal-El of Krypton is the first superhero, with all future endeavors owing a debt in one form or another to the Man of Steel since the first pages of Action Comics #1. Even in his civilian guise as Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent, Superman is the example by which all other superheroes follow.

###Superman: Up, Up, and Away!

Written by: Kurt Busiek and Geoff Johns  
Art by: Pete Woods and Renato Guedes  
First Published: 2006  

&gt;No one has seen or heard from the Man of Steel in this collection from iconic writers Kurt Busiek and Geoff Johns. 

&gt;As Clark Kent concentrates on his career, the need for the Man of Steel is stronger than ever-especially now that Lex Luthor has returned to Metropolis with his thirst for power fully intact! 

After Infinite Crisis, Superman entered an era of fantastic storytelling. Geoff Johns and Richard Donner, director of 1978's Superman movie, took over Action Comics and Kurt Busiek, writer of Superman: Secret Identity, took over Superman. Both writers kick off this era of Superman with the crossover Up! Up! and Away! before beginning this legendary time in Superman history.

##Greatest Hits  

Superman has seen a number of legendary creators make their mark on his legacy, often told through in self-contained runs.  

###Superman: Secret Identity  
Written by: Kurt Busiek  
Art by: Stuart Immonen  
First Published: 2004  

&gt;Set in the real world, SECRET IDENTITY examines the life of a young Kansas man with the unfortunate name of Clark Kent.All Clark wants is to be a writer, but his daily life is filled with the taunts and jibes of his peers, comparing him to that other Clark Kent — the one with super-powers. Until one day when Clark awakens to discover that he can fly...that he does in fact have super-strength! But where did these powers come from? And what's he going to do about it?

*Superman: Secret Identity* is a beautiful story about growing up, growing old, being a superhero, and being a family man. It uses the elseworlds premise to explore the inner core of the character without any distractions. Take away all the toys, the super-villains, the Fortress of Solitude, Metropolis, and make something that is pure, complete Superman and you get *Superman: Secret Identity.*

###Superman: Action Comics, by Grant Morrison  
Written by: Grant Morrison  
Art by: Rags Morales  
First Published: 2011  

&gt;DC Comics took a bold step and renumbered the longest-running monthly comic, Action Comics, to #1 for the first time since 1938 as part of the DC Comics—The New 52 event.

&gt;With this renumbering comes a new creative team featuring comics legend Grant Morrison and fan-favorite artist Rag Morales. While Morrison is no stranger to writing the Superman character, having won three Eisner Award's for his work on All-Star Superman, Action Comics will be something new for both old and new readers and present humanity's first encounters with Superman, before he became one of the World's Greatest Super Heroes. Set a few years in the past, it's a bold new take on a classic hero.

Morrison's Action Comics is a bold origin story for Superman that deviates from many others. It captures the feel of Golden Age 1930's Superman in a modern context and integrates it with the rest of the character. Of all the origin revamps of the New 52, Morrison manages to make something strikingly modern, yet exceptionally reverent to the character.

&gt;But even as Kal-El and Kara struggle to contain this new existential threat, the world's greatest superhero faces a completely different challenge in his adopted home city of Metropolis, where Clark Kent still lives and works--but without his wife and son.

&gt;The stage is set for a reckoning like nothing Superman has ever faced, and everything that matters to the Man of Steel hangs in the balance!
